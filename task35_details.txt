Title: Full E2E Pipeline Execution and Resolution Loop

Description: Execute the complete end-to-end BDD test with real API keys, mockup generation, and email delivery using EMAIL_OVERRIDE. Re-run the preflight validation first. If anything fails, create fixup tasks and retry until success.

Details:
1. Load '.env.e2e' and verify EMAIL_OVERRIDE and real API keys are present
2. Run 'bin/e2e_validate_config.py' from previous task
   - If it fails, abort and create a new task titled "Fix E2E Preflight Failure: <summary>"
3. If preflight passes, run the full BDD scenario:
   - End-to-end lead processed and email sent
   - Validate:
     - Screenshot and mockup created
     - Email sent via SendGrid (response 202)
     - DB contains new 'emails' row
4. Write summary to 'e2e_summary.md' with:
   - Lead ID
   - Screenshot/mockup paths
   - SendGrid message ID
   - API costs
5. If the test fails:
   - Write error log
   - Auto-create task titled "Fix E2E Test Failure: <summary>"
   - Retry once the fix task is complete
6. Only complete this task when:
   - Preflight passes
   - BDD test passes
   - Email is verifiably delivered to EMAIL_OVERRIDE
   - 'e2e_summary.md' is present and complete

Test Strategy:
- All components must pass preflight first
- BDD must assert complete success path
- Email must arrive in inbox
- Summary log must show all expected output
