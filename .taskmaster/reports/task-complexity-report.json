      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the A/B testing implementation for email subject lines and price variants into detailed subtasks covering variant definition, selection mechanism, tracking, reporting, email system integration, configuration interface, and comprehensive testing. For each subtask, provide specific implementation details, dependencies, and test strategies.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires building a specialized A/B testing system with multiple components including variant definition, selection, tracking, and reporting. The complexity comes from ensuring statistical validity, proper integration with the email system, and accurate performance tracking. The existing 7 subtasks cover the main components but could benefit from more detailed implementation steps."
