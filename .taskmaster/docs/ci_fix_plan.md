# CI Pipeline Fix Plan

## Step 1: Basic CI Configuration Fix

1. Create a minimal version of `setup_test_environment.py` that only creates essential directories
2. Update `install_test_tools.py` to check if packages are already installed
3. Add error handling to both scripts
4. Push and verify CI runs (even if tests fail)

## Step 2: Database Configuration Fix

1. Update `setup_test_environment.py` to properly handle both SQLite and PostgreSQL
2. Add environment variable detection to use the right database
3. Add error handling for database operations
4. Push and verify

## Step 3: Test Status Tracker Fix

1. Update `test_status_tracker.py` to work without visualization if dependencies aren't available
2. Add better error handling for file operations
3. Make visualization optional
4. Push and verify

## Step 4: Enable Core Utility Tests

1. Update CI workflow to only run a small subset of critical tests
2. Remove complex test operations until basic tests pass
3. Push and verify

## Step 5: Incremental Test Re-enablement

1. Once core tests pass, gradually enable more tests
2. Add test categorization and prioritization
3. Push and verify after each batch

## Verification Process

For each step:
1. Make focused changes addressing a single issue
2. Test locally to ensure basic functionality
3. Push to the feature branch
4. Check GitHub Actions logs for success/failure
5. Document findings and adjust approach as needed

## Success Criteria

- CI workflow runs without errors
- Core utility tests pass
- Test environment setup completes successfully
- Test status tracking works correctly
- Incremental progress toward enabling all tests
