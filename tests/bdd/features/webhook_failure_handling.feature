Feature: Webhook Failure Handling
  As a system administrator
  I want robust webhook failure handling with retry mechanisms
  So that webhook events are processed reliably even during transient failures

  Background:
    Given the webhook failure handling system is initialized
    And webhook configurations are loaded
    And monitoring is active

  Scenario: Successfully process a valid SendGrid webhook
    Given a valid SendGrid email delivery webhook payload
    When the webhook is received
    Then the webhook should be validated successfully
    And the event should be processed by the appropriate handler
    And engagement tracking should record the email delivery
    And the webhook status should be "completed"
    And no errors should be recorded

  Scenario: Handle invalid webhook payload
    Given an invalid JSON webhook payload
    When the webhook is received
    Then webhook validation should fail
    And a validation error should be recorded
    And the webhook status should be "failed"
    And no retry should be scheduled

  Scenario: Retry webhook after transient failure
    Given a valid webhook payload
    And the webhook handler will fail temporarily
    When the webhook is received
    Then the initial processing should fail
    And the webhook should be scheduled for retry
    And the retry should be processed with exponential backoff
    And eventually the webhook should succeed

  Scenario: Move webhook to dead letter queue after max retries
    Given a valid webhook payload
    And the webhook handler will always fail
    When the webhook is received and retried multiple times
    Then all retry attempts should fail
    And the webhook should be moved to the dead letter queue
    And an alert should be triggered
    And the dead letter queue should contain the event

  Scenario: Circuit breaker prevents cascading failures
    Given multiple webhook failures for the same webhook type
    When the failure threshold is exceeded
    Then the circuit breaker should open
    And new webhooks should be rejected temporarily
    And after the recovery timeout, the circuit breaker should allow test requests
    And successful requests should close the circuit breaker

  Scenario: Rate limiting prevents webhook abuse
    Given a webhook with rate limiting enabled
    When webhooks are received rapidly exceeding the rate limit
    Then initial webhooks should be processed successfully
    And subsequent webhooks should be rejected with rate limit error
    And rate limiting should reset after the time window

  Scenario: Signature verification for secure webhooks
    Given a webhook with signature verification enabled
    When a webhook is received with a valid signature
    Then the signature should be verified successfully
    And the webhook should be processed normally
    When a webhook is received with an invalid signature
    Then signature verification should fail
    And the webhook should be rejected

  Scenario: Health monitoring tracks webhook performance
    Given webhook health monitoring is active
    When multiple webhooks are processed with varying success rates
    Then health metrics should be calculated and stored
    And the webhook health status should reflect the current performance
    And alerts should be triggered when thresholds are exceeded

  Scenario: Dead letter queue management and reprocessing
    Given webhooks in the dead letter queue
    When an administrator reviews the dead letter events
    Then they should be able to view event details and reasons for failure
    When an administrator attempts to reprocess a dead letter event
    Then the event should be removed from dead letter queue
    And processed again through the normal webhook pipeline

  Scenario: Priority-based retry queue processing
    Given webhooks of different priorities in the retry queue
    When the retry queue is processed
    Then critical priority webhooks should be processed first
    And high priority webhooks should be processed next
    And normal and low priority webhooks should be processed in order

  Scenario: Webhook integration with engagement tracking
    Given engagement tracking is enabled
    When an email open webhook is received
    Then the email open event should be tracked in engagement analytics
    And user session data should be updated
    And conversion funnels should be checked
    When a payment success webhook is received
    Then the purchase event should be tracked
    And customer engagement metrics should be updated

  Scenario: Admin interface for webhook management
    Given the webhook admin interface is available
    When an administrator views the webhook dashboard
    Then they should see overall system health status
    And webhook processing statistics
    And retry queue status
    And dead letter queue summary
    When an administrator forces a retry of a specific event
    Then the event should be moved to high priority in retry queue
    And processed immediately

  Scenario: Bulk operations for dead letter queue
    Given multiple events in the dead letter queue
    When an administrator performs bulk reprocessing
    Then eligible events should be reprocessed
    And success/failure counts should be reported
    When an administrator archives old resolved events
    Then events older than the specified threshold should be archived
    And storage space should be freed

  Scenario: Webhook configuration management
    Given webhook configurations can be updated
    When an administrator updates health check thresholds
    Then the new thresholds should be applied immediately
    And health monitoring should use the updated values
    When an administrator disables a webhook
    Then new webhook requests should be rejected
    And existing retries should be paused

  Scenario: Error categorization and routing
    Given different types of webhook errors
    When a network timeout error occurs
    Then the error should be categorized as transient
    And the webhook should be scheduled for retry
    When a validation error occurs
    Then the error should be categorized as permanent
    And the webhook should not be retried
    When a critical system error occurs
    Then an immediate alert should be triggered
    And the webhook should be moved to dead letter queue

  Scenario: Metrics and analytics for webhook performance
    Given webhook performance tracking is enabled
    When webhooks are processed over time
    Then success rates should be calculated and stored
    And response time metrics should be tracked
    And throughput statistics should be maintained
    And performance trends should be available for analysis

  Scenario: Integration with external monitoring systems
    Given external monitoring integration is configured
    When webhook health status changes
    Then alerts should be sent to external systems
    And webhook metrics should be exported
    And dashboards should reflect current webhook health
