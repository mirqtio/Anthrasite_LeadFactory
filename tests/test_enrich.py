Feature: Lead Enrichment
  As a marketing manager
  I want to enrich business data with additional information
  So that I can better understand and target potential leads
  Background:
    Given the database is initialized
    And the API keys are configured
  Scenario: Enrich business with website data
    Given a business with a website
    When I run the enrichment process
    Then the business should have technical stack information
    And the business should have performance metrics
    And the enriched data should be saved to the database
  Scenario: Enrich business without website
    Given a business without a website
    When I run the enrichment process
    Then the business should be marked for manual review
    And the business should have a status of "needs_website"
    And the enrichment process should continue to the next business
  Scenario: Handle API errors gracefully
    Given a business with a website
    And the enrichment API is unavailable
    When I run the enrichment process
    Then the error should be logged
    And the business should be marked for retry
    And the process should continue without crashing
  Scenario: Skip already enriched businesses
    Given a business that has already been enriched
    When I run the enrichment process
    Then the business should be skipped
    And the enrichment process should continue to the next business
  Scenario: Prioritize businesses by score
    Given multiple businesses with different scores
    When I run the enrichment process with prioritization
    Then businesses should be processed in descending score order
