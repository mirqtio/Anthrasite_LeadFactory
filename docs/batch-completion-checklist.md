# Batch Completion Monitoring Implementation Checklist

## Feature Overview
The Batch Completion Monitoring system tracks the progress and completion status of nightly batch processes in the Anthrasite LeadFactory. It provides metrics, alerts, and monitoring capabilities to ensure that batches complete successfully and on time.

## Implementation Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [x] Batch tracker module (`utils/batch_tracker.py`) for recording batch status
- [x] Batch completion monitor script (`bin/batch_completion_monitor.py`) for checking completion status
- [x] Integration with nightly batch process (`bin/run_nightly.sh`)
- [x] Email alert system for incomplete batches
- [x] Systemd service for continuous monitoring
- [x] Prometheus metrics for batch completion status
- [x] Grafana dashboard for visualizing batch metrics
- [x] Grafana alert rules for batch completion failures

### Error Handling and Logging
- [x] Proper error handling in batch tracker functions
- [x] Comprehensive logging of batch status changes
- [x] Detailed error messages in alert emails
- [x] Graceful handling of missing or corrupt tracker files
- [x] Retry logic for transient failures

### Testing
- [x] BDD feature file (`tests/features/batch_completion.feature`)
- [x] BDD test implementation (`tests/test_batch_completion.py`)
- [x] Unit tests for core functions
- [x] Test coverage for error conditions
- [x] Mock objects for external dependencies

### Documentation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (`docs/batch-completion-monitoring.md`)
- [x] Installation instructions for systemd service
- [x] Configuration options and environment variables
- [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Grafana dashboard and alert configuration

### Quality Assurance
- [x] Code follows PEP8 style guidelines
- [x] Functions have clear docstrings
- [x] Variables have descriptive names
- [x] Complex logic is commented
- [x] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Pre-Commit Phase
- [x] Run static analysis tools (ruff, bandit)
- [x] Run code formatting (black)
- [x] Verify feature functionality after fixes

### Metrics and Alerts
- [x] Batch completion percentage gauge
- [x] Stage completion percentage gauges
- [x] Batch completion time histogram
- [x] Batch completion success gauge
- [x] Cost per lead gauge
- [x] GPU cost counter
- [x] Alert for incomplete batches
- [x] Alert for high cost per lead
- [x] Alert for high GPU cost

## Verification Steps

1. **Verify Batch Tracking**
   - Start a batch with `record_batch_start()`
   - Record stage completions with `record_batch_stage_completion()`
   - End the batch with `record_batch_end()`
   - Verify the batch tracker file contains the correct information

2. **Verify Batch Completion Monitoring**
   - Run the batch completion monitor with `./bin/batch_completion_monitor.py --once`
   - Verify it correctly identifies completed and incomplete batches
   - Verify alert emails are sent for incomplete batches

3. **Verify Metrics**
   - Start the metrics server
   - Access the `/metrics` endpoint
   - Verify batch completion metrics are present
   - Verify metrics update when batch status changes

4. **Verify Grafana Integration**
   - Import the dashboard configuration
   - Verify all panels display correctly
   - Verify alert rules are properly configured

5. **Verify Systemd Service**
   - Install the service with `sudo ./bin/install_batch_monitor_service.sh`
   - Verify the service starts automatically
   - Verify the service restarts after failures

## Compliance with Feature Development Workflow
This implementation follows the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) by:
- Including comprehensive error handling and logging
- Adding unit tests and BDD tests
- Providing detailed documentation
- Following code quality standards
- Including verification steps
- Setting up monitoring and alerting

## Next Steps
- Deploy to staging environment
- Monitor batch completion status for a few days
- Gather feedback and make adjustments as needed
- Deploy to production environment
