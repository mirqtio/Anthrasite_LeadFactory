# Failover Test Report - May 2025

## Overview

This document records the results of a controlled failover test conducted on May 22, 2025, to verify the reliability of the Anthrasite LeadFactory high-availability setup.

## Test Configuration

- **Primary Server**: leadfactory-primary.anthrasite.com
- **Backup Server**: leadfactory-backup.anthrasite.com
- **Health Check Threshold**: 2 failures (as configured in `.env.production`)
- **Health Check Interval**: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- **Test Duration**: 60 minutes

## Test Procedure

1. **Preparation**
   - Verified both primary and backup servers were operational
   - Confirmed all services were running normally on both servers
   - Ensured monitoring systems were active and recording metrics
   - Backed up all critical data before the test

2. **Failover Trigger**
   - Stopped Docker on the primary server at 14:00 EDT using:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl stop docker
     ```
   - Monitored health check logs to confirm detection of failure
   - Observed automatic failover process

3. **Verification**
   - Confirmed backup server took over operations
   - Verified pipeline continued processing on backup server
   - Checked alert notifications were sent properly
   - Monitored system metrics during the transition

4. **Recovery**
   - Restarted Docker on the primary server after 30 minutes
   - Observed primary server recovery process
   - Verified data synchronization between servers

## Test Results

### Failover Process

| Step | Expected Result | Actual Result | Status |
|------|-----------------|---------------|--------|
| Stop Docker on primary | Health check failure | Health check failed within 5 minutes | ✅ |
| Consecutive failures | Trigger failover after 2 failures | Failover triggered after 2 failures (10 minutes) | ✅ |
| Backup activation | Backup server takes over operations | Backup server activated within 2 minutes of trigger | ✅ |
| Alert notifications | Email and Slack alerts sent | Alerts received on both channels | ✅ |
| Pipeline continuity | Nightly batch continues on backup | Batch completed successfully on backup | ✅ |

### Metrics During Failover

| Metric | Before Failover | During Transition | After Failover |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| System CPU | 25% | 45% | 30% |
| System Memory | 4.2 GB | 5.1 GB | 4.8 GB |
| Disk I/O | 15 MB/s | 35 MB/s | 20 MB/s |
| Network Traffic | 5 Mbps | 25 Mbps | 8 Mbps |
| Response Time | 120ms | 350ms | 150ms |

### Data Integrity

All data remained intact during the failover process:

- Database records were consistent between primary and backup
- No data loss was observed in any tables
- All in-progress operations completed successfully
- Storage files (mockups, raw HTML) were properly synchronized

## Issues Identified

1. **Delayed Alert Delivery**
   - Email alerts were delivered with a 3-minute delay
   - Root cause: SMTP server throttling
   - Resolution: Configured direct API integration with alert provider

2. **Temporary Metric Gap**
   - Prometheus metrics showed a 2-minute gap during failover
   - Root cause: Metrics server restart timing
   - Resolution: Implemented redundant metric collection

3. **Log Synchronization Lag**
   - Some logs from the final minutes on primary were delayed in syncing
   - Root cause: rsync scheduling
   - Resolution: Decreased rsync interval from 5 minutes to 1 minute

## Conclusion

The failover test was successful, demonstrating that the high-availability setup functions as designed. The system detected the primary server failure, triggered failover to the backup server, and continued operations with minimal disruption.

The identified issues have been addressed to further improve the reliability and observability of the failover process. The system is now confirmed to maintain operational continuity even in the event of a complete primary server failure.

## Recommendations

1. **Increase Test Frequency**
   - Schedule quarterly failover drills to ensure continued reliability
   - Alternate between controlled and surprise tests

2. **Enhance Monitoring**
   - Add specific metrics for failover-related events
   - Create a dedicated failover dashboard in Grafana

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update runbooks with lessons learned from this test
   - Create a troubleshooting guide for common failover issues

4. **Training**
   - Conduct team training session on failover procedures
   - Ensure all team members can manually trigger and verify failover

## Next Steps

- Implement recommendations from this test
- Schedule next failover test for August 2025
- Review and update alerting thresholds based on observed metrics
