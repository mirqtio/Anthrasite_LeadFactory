## Recommended Execution Order

Based on dependencies and complexity:

### Phase 1 - Foundation (Low Complexity)
1. **Task #16** - Add CLI Commands (4 subtasks)
   - Prerequisite for testing other features
   - Low risk, high value

### Phase 2 - Core Features (Medium-High Complexity)
2. **Task #17** - Tier-Based Processing (6 subtasks)
   - Enables cost optimization
   - Foundation for tier-specific features

3. **Task #20** - MOCKUP_ENABLED Flag (3 subtasks)
   - Complements tier-based processing
   - Simple configuration addition

### Phase 3 - Reliability & Scale (High Complexity)
4. **Task #19** - LLM Fallback Mechanism (6 subtasks)
   - Critical for system reliability
   - Complex but isolated implementation

5. **Task #21** - IP Pool Switching (6 subtasks)
   - Protects email deliverability
   - Requires careful monitoring setup

### Phase 4 - Advanced Features (Highest Complexity)
6. **Task #18** - A/B Testing Support (6 subtasks)
   - Enhances marketing capabilities
   - Complex but optional feature

7. **Task #22** - GPU Auto-Scaling (6 subtasks)
   - Performance optimization
   - Infrastructure automation

## Success Metrics

For each expanded task:
- All subtasks completed and tested
- CI pipeline passes with new features
- Documentation updated
- BDD tests cover new functionality
- Performance benchmarks established

## Resource Estimation

Based on complexity scores:
- **Low Complexity (4)**: ~1-2 days per task
- **Medium Complexity (5)**: ~2-3 days per task
- **High Complexity (7-8)**: ~4-5 days per task

**Total Estimated Effort**: ~25-30 days for all pending tasks

## Next Actions

1. Start with Task #16 (recommended by task-master)
2. Complete subtasks sequentially within each task
3. Ensure test coverage before moving to next task
4. Update documentation continuously
5. Monitor CI pipeline for integration issues
