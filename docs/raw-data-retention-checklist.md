# Raw Data Retention Implementation Checklist

This checklist follows the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) for implementing raw data retention features in the Anthrasite LeadFactory.

## 1. Development Phase

### Database Schema
- [x] Create migration script for `raw_html_storage` table
- [x] Create migration script for `llm_logs` table
- [x] Update businesses table with `html_path` column
- [x] Create PostgreSQL versions of all migration scripts

### Core Utilities
- [x] Implement HTML storage and retrieval functions
- [x] Implement LLM logging functions
- [x] Implement data retention management functions
- [x] Implement 90-day retention policy

### Integration
- [x] Create website scraper module for HTML storage
- [x] Create LLM logger module for LLM interaction logging
- [x] Integrate with existing scraper code
- [x] Update nightly batch script to include data retention processes

### Command-line Tools
- [x] Create script for processing pending websites
- [x] Create script for cleaning up expired data
- [x] Add command-line options for dry runs and verbose output

### Error Handling
- [x] Add robust error handling for all file operations
- [x] Add robust error handling for all database operations
- [x] Implement proper logging for all processes
- [x] Handle edge cases (missing files, database inconsistencies)

### Documentation
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation for raw data retention features
- [x] Document database schema changes
- [x] Document API for HTML storage and LLM logging
- [x] Create implementation checklist

## 2. Testing Phase

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Test HTML compression and decompression
- [ ] Test storage path generation
- [ ] Test LLM logging functions
- [ ] Test data retention management functions

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Test website scraper integration
- [ ] Test LLM logger integration
- [ ] Test nightly batch job integration
- [ ] Test cleanup process

### Performance Tests
- [ ] Test HTML storage performance with large files
- [ ] Test LLM logging performance with large responses
- [ ] Test cleanup performance with large datasets

### Code Coverage
- [ ] Ensure at least 80% code coverage for all new modules
- [ ] Verify all edge cases are covered by tests

## 3. Quality Assurance Phase

### Static Analysis
- [ ] Run ruff on all new Python files
- [ ] Run bandit for security checks
- [ ] Address all identified issues

### Code Formatting
- [ ] Run black on all new Python files
- [ ] Ensure consistent code style

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Review all documentation for completeness
- [ ] Ensure all functions have proper docstrings
- [ ] Verify example code is correct and works as expected

## 4. Pre-Commit Phase

### Pre-commit Hooks
- [ ] Run pre-commit hooks locally
- [ ] Fix any issues identified
- [ ] Verify feature functionality after fixes

### Final Verification
- [ ] Manually test HTML storage with real websites
- [ ] Manually test LLM logging with real interactions
- [ ] Verify cleanup process works as expected
- [ ] Check all environment variables are properly documented

## 5. Commit Phase

### Feature Branch
- [ ] Create feature branch with descriptive name (e.g., `feature/raw-data-retention`)
- [ ] Commit all changes with clear messages
- [ ] Push to remote repository

### Pull Request
- [ ] Create pull request with detailed description
- [ ] Reference related tasks and issues
- [ ] Assign reviewers

## 6. CI Verification Phase

### CI Pipeline
- [ ] Verify CI pipeline passes
- [ ] Address any CI issues
- [ ] Request code review

### Deployment
- [ ] Verify database migrations run successfully
- [ ] Verify all new modules are included in deployment
- [ ] Verify environment variables are properly configured

## 7. Post-Implementation Verification

### Monitoring
- [ ] Verify HTML storage is working in production
- [ ] Verify LLM logging is working in production
- [ ] Verify cleanup process is working in production
- [ ] Check storage usage and growth rate

### Performance
- [ ] Monitor impact on system performance
- [ ] Optimize if necessary

### Documentation
- [ ] Update any documentation based on production observations
- [ ] Document any issues or lessons learned
