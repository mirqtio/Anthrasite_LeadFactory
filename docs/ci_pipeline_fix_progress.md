# CI Pipeline Fix Progress

This document tracks the progress of our systematic approach to fixing the CI pipeline issues in the Anthrasite LeadFactory project. It follows the principles outlined in our [CI Fix Plan](../scripts/ci_fix_plan.md).

## Core Principles
1. **Incremental Changes**: Make small, focused changes that address one issue at a time
2. **Continuous Verification**: Push each change to GitHub and verify it passes CI before proceeding
3. **Evidence-Based Fixes**: Base fixes on actual CI failure logs, not assumptions
4. **Rollback Capability**: Be prepared to revert changes that don't work
5. **Documentation**: Document each step and its outcome for future reference

## Progress Tracking

### Step 1: Basic CI Configuration Fix
**Status**: âœ… Completed and Verified Locally

**Changes Made**:
- Created `scripts/minimal_test_setup.py` with essential directory creation and error handling
- Created `scripts/minimal_test_tools.py` with dependency checking and error handling
- Created `scripts/minimal_test_tracker.py` with essential test tracking without visualization dependencies
- Created `.github/workflows/minimal-ci.yml` workflow to verify basic functionality
- Created `scripts/verify_minimal_ci.py` to test minimal CI components locally

**Verification Results**:
- All minimal CI components verified successfully locally
- Test environment setup creates all required directories
- Test tools installation verifies and installs essential dependencies
- Test tracker successfully discovers and reports on tests
- Simple test execution works correctly

**Next Steps**:
- Wait for GitHub Actions to complete on the `fix-ci-pipeline` branch
- Examine logs for success/failure
- If successful, proceed to Step 2: Test Environment Setup
- If failed, fix issues based on CI logs and repeat

### Step 2: Test Environment Setup
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

**Planned Changes**:
- Enhance minimal test environment setup with database schema creation
- Add mock data setup for essential tables
- Configure additional environment variables for testing

### Step 3: Import Path Resolution
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

**Planned Changes**:
- Create minimal path fix script
- Fix Python path and import issues
- Verify import errors are resolved

### Step 4: Enable Core Utility Tests
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

**Planned Changes**:
- Enable a small subset of critical utility tests
- Verify core tests pass

### Step 5: Test Status Tracking
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

**Planned Changes**:
- Enhance test status tracking with failure categorization
- Add automatic recommendations for fixing test failures

### Step 6: Incremental Test Re-enablement
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

**Planned Changes**:
- Enable additional tests in small batches
- Verify each batch passes before enabling more

### Step 7: Final Verification and Documentation
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Pending

**Planned Changes**:
- Run comprehensive test suite
- Document remaining issues
- Create plan for addressing remaining failures

## Rollback Strategy
If a change causes unexpected failures:
1. Immediately revert the problematic commit
2. Create a new approach based on the failure logs
3. Test the new approach locally before pushing again
4. Document what didn't work and why

## Lessons Learned
- Creating minimal, focused scripts helps isolate issues
- Local verification before pushing saves time
- Comprehensive error handling and logging are essential for debugging CI issues
