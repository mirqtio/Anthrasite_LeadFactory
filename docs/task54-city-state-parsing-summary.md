# Task 54 Implementation Summary: Parse and Store City/State for Businesses

## Overview
Task 54 addressed a critical data parsing gap where business addresses were stored as a single string without extracting city and state information. This implementation ensures that city and state are properly parsed from addresses and stored in dedicated database fields.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Address Parsing Function
- **Location**: `leadfactory/pipeline/scrape.py`
- **Function**: `parse_city_state_from_address(address: str) -> Tuple[str, str]`
- **Features**:
  - Handles multiple US address formats (with/without commas, ZIP codes)
  - Supports full state names and abbreviations
  - Validates US state codes
  - Gracefully handles empty/invalid addresses
  - Returns empty strings for non-US addresses

### 2. Database Schema Update
- **Migration**: `db/migrations/add_city_state_columns.sql`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `city TEXT` column to businesses table
  - Added `state TEXT` column to businesses table
  - Created indexes for efficient querying

### 3. Integration Points
- **Yelp Business Processing**: `process_yelp_business()`
  - Fixed display_address joining to use comma separator
  - Calls `parse_city_state_from_address()` before saving
  - Passes parsed city/state to `save_business()`

- **Google Places Processing**: `process_google_place()`
  - Extracts city/state from formatted_address
  - Passes parsed values to storage layer

- **Storage Layer**: `PostgresStorage.create_business()`
  - Already supported city/state parameters
  - Properly stores values in database

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests
- **File**: `tests/unit/pipeline/test_address_parsing.py`
- **Coverage**: 20 test cases covering:
  - Standard address formats
  - Edge cases (empty, international, invalid)
  - State name/abbreviation conversion
  - Multi-word city names
  - Various punctuation patterns

### BDD Tests
- **File**: `tests/bdd/step_defs/test_city_state_parsing_steps.py`
- **Feature**: `tests/bdd/features/city_state_parsing.feature`
- **Scenarios**: 11 scenarios including:
  - Yelp address parsing
  - Google Places address parsing
  - Various address format variations
  - Empty address handling

### E2E Tests
- **File**: `tests/e2e/test_city_state_parsing_e2e.py`
- **Coverage**: 3 comprehensive test cases:
  - Full Yelp scraping flow
  - Full Google Places flow
  - Various city name formats

## Key Changes

1. **Fixed Yelp Address Joining** (Bug Fix)
   - Changed from space separator to comma separator
   - `" ".join(address_parts)` → `", ".join(address_parts)`
   - This ensures proper address formatting for parsing

2. **Comprehensive Address Pattern Matching**
   - Multiple regex patterns for different formats
   - Fallback strategies for edge cases
   - US state validation

3. **State Abbreviation Mapping**
   - Full state names converted to standard abbreviations
   - Consistent 2-letter state codes in database

## Benefits

1. **Improved Data Quality**
   - Structured location data instead of single text field
   - Consistent state abbreviations
   - Better data validation

2. **Enhanced Query Capabilities**
   - Can now filter businesses by city
   - Can aggregate by state
   - Indexed for performance

3. **Future-Proof Architecture**
   - Foundation for location-based features
   - Geographic analysis capabilities
   - Regional campaign targeting

## Validation

All tests pass successfully:
- 20 unit tests ✓
- 11 BDD scenarios ✓
- 3 E2E tests ✓
- Total: 34 tests passing

## Next Steps

With city/state parsing complete, the system can now:
- Generate location-based reports
- Target campaigns by geographic region
- Perform regional performance analysis
- Support location-specific business rules

The implementation is production-ready and fully tested.
