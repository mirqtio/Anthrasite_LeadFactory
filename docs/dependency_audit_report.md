# Dependency Audit Report

## Summary of Changes

This report documents the dependency audit performed on May 25, 2025, including:
- Unused dependencies that were removed
- Missing dependencies that were added
- Security vulnerabilities that were fixed
- Configuration improvements for dependency management

## Removed Unused Dependencies

The following dependencies were found to be unused and have been removed:

- **SQLAlchemy**: Not imported in any application code, likely a leftover from an earlier architecture
- **pytest-mock**: Not used in any test files; standard unittest.mock is used instead
- Other dependencies with redundant or overlapping functionality

## Added Missing Dependencies

The following dependencies were added as they were found to be used but not explicitly included:

- **python-Levenshtein**: Used for string matching operations
- **openai**: Used for API integrations in mockup generation
- **sendgrid**: Used for email delivery functionality
- **seaborn**: Used for metrics visualization
- **behave**: Used for BDD testing
- **matplotlib**: Used for metrics visualization
- **pandas**: Used for data processing and reporting
- **pytest-json-report**: Used in CI for test reporting
- **pytest-xdist**: Used for parallel test execution
- **pip-audit**: Added for dependency security scanning

## Security Vulnerabilities Fixed

The security audit identified the following vulnerabilities that have been addressed:

1. **FastAPI (0.95.2)**: Vulnerable to [PYSEC-2024-38](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7)
   - Updated to version 0.115.0

2. **Starlette (0.27.0)**: Vulnerable to [GHSA-f96h-pmfr-66vw](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-f96h-pmfr-66vw)
   - Created constraints.txt to enforce Starlette 0.40.0 which fixes the vulnerability

3. **Pydantic (1.10.8)**: Vulnerable to [GHSA-mr82-8j83-vxmv](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mr82-8j83-vxmv)
   - Updated to version 1.10.13

4. **python-multipart (0.0.6)**: Vulnerable to [GHSA-2jv5-9r88-3w3p](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2jv5-9r88-3w3p) and [GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-59g5-xgcq-4qw3)
   - Updated to version 0.0.18

5. **Black (24.0.0)**: Version has been yanked from PyPI
   - Updated to latest stable version 24.3.0

## Configuration Improvements

1. **Dependency Pinning**: All dependencies now use exact version pins (`==`) instead of flexible ranges (`>=`) for better reproducibility

2. **Hierarchical Requirements File Organization**:
   - `requirements.txt`: Core production dependencies only
   - `requirements-test.txt`: Testing dependencies (includes production deps)
   - `requirements-ci.txt`: CI environment dependencies (includes test deps)
   - `requirements-dev.txt`: Development environment dependencies (includes CI deps)
   - `requirements-metrics.txt`: Metrics collection and reporting dependencies
   - `constraints.txt`: Version constraints to enforce specific dependency versions

3. **Dependency Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive `docs/dependency_management.md` guide
   - Documented hierarchical structure and installation instructions
   - Added guidelines for updating dependencies and security considerations

4. **Dependabot Integration**:
   - Added `.github/dependabot.yml` for automated dependency updates
   - Configured weekly scans for both pip packages and GitHub Actions
   - Set up dependency grouping for related packages (e.g., pytest plugins)

5. **CI Workflow Improvements**:
   - Updated workflows to use appropriate requirements files
   - Fixed context access issues in GitHub Actions workflow files
   - Added constraints file support to enforce secure dependency versions
   - Added fallback values for secrets to prevent workflow failures

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Run `pip-audit` at least monthly to check for new vulnerabilities
2. **Review Dependabot PRs**: Regularly review and merge Dependabot pull requests
3. **Update Testing**: When updating major dependencies, ensure thorough testing is performed
4. **Documentation**: Keep dependency documentation updated as requirements change

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Dependabot pull requests for dependency updates
2. Consider implementing a dependency license compliance check
3. Evaluate if any of the dependencies can be further consolidated
