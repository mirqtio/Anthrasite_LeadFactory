# Cost Metrics Monitoring Implementation Checklist

## Feature Overview
The Cost Metrics Monitoring system tracks and reports on cost-related metrics in the Anthrasite LeadFactory, including cost-per-lead and GPU usage costs. It provides metrics, alerts, and monitoring capabilities to ensure that costs remain within acceptable thresholds.

## Implementation Checklist

### Core Functionality
- [x] Cost metrics module (`utils/cost_metrics.py`) for tracking and reporting costs
- [x] Cost-per-lead calculation at the end of batch runs
- [x] GPU usage tracking when GPU_BURST flag is enabled
- [x] Threshold checking for cost-per-lead and GPU costs
- [x] GPU usage tracker script (`bin/track_gpu_usage.py`) for continuous monitoring
- [x] Email alert system for cost threshold violations
- [x] Systemd service for continuous GPU usage monitoring
- [x] Prometheus metrics for cost-per-lead and GPU costs
- [x] Grafana dashboard for visualizing cost metrics
- [x] Grafana alert rules for cost threshold violations

### Error Handling and Logging
- [x] Proper error handling in cost metrics functions
- [x] Comprehensive logging of cost changes and threshold violations
- [x] Detailed error messages in alert emails
- [x] Graceful handling of missing or corrupt tracker files
- [x] Retry logic for transient failures

### Testing
- [x] BDD feature file (`tests/features/cost_metrics.feature`)
- [x] BDD test implementation (`tests/test_cost_metrics.py`)
- [x] Unit tests for core functions
- [x] Test coverage for error conditions
- [x] Mock objects for external dependencies

### Documentation
- [x] Comprehensive documentation (`docs/cost-metrics-monitoring.md`)
- [x] Installation instructions for systemd service
- [x] Configuration options and environment variables
- [x] Troubleshooting guide
- [x] Grafana dashboard and alert configuration

### Quality Assurance
- [x] Code follows PEP8 style guidelines
- [x] Functions have clear docstrings
- [x] Variables have descriptive names
- [x] Complex logic is commented
- [x] No hardcoded secrets or credentials

### Pre-Commit Phase
- [x] Run static analysis tools (ruff, bandit)
- [x] Run code formatting (black)
- [x] Verify feature functionality after fixes

### Metrics and Alerts
- [x] Cost-per-lead gauge
- [x] GPU cost counter
- [x] Alert for high cost-per-lead
- [x] Alert for high daily GPU cost
- [x] Alert for high monthly GPU cost

## Verification Steps

1. **Verify Cost-Per-Lead Calculation**
   - Run a batch with `./bin/run_nightly.sh`
   - Verify cost-per-lead is calculated at the end of the batch
   - Check the cost tracker file for the correct value
   - Verify the Prometheus metric is updated

2. **Verify GPU Usage Tracking**
   - Set the GPU_BURST flag with `export GPU_BURST=1`
   - Run the GPU usage tracker with `./bin/track_gpu_usage.py --once`
   - Verify GPU costs are tracked in the cost tracker file
   - Verify the Prometheus metric is updated
   - Unset the flag with `unset GPU_BURST` and verify no costs are tracked

3. **Verify Threshold Checking**
   - Set cost-per-lead above threshold and verify alert is triggered
   - Set GPU costs above thresholds and verify alerts are triggered
   - Reset costs below thresholds and verify no alerts are triggered

4. **Verify Metrics**
   - Start the metrics server
   - Access the `/metrics` endpoint
   - Verify cost metrics are present
   - Verify metrics update when costs change

5. **Verify Grafana Integration**
   - Import the dashboard configuration
   - Verify all panels display correctly
   - Verify alert rules are properly configured

6. **Verify Systemd Service**
   - Install the service with `sudo ./bin/install_gpu_tracker_service.sh`
   - Verify the service starts automatically
   - Verify the service restarts after failures

## Compliance with Feature Development Workflow
This implementation follows the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) by:
- Including comprehensive error handling and logging
- Adding unit tests and BDD tests
- Providing detailed documentation
- Following code quality standards
- Including verification steps
- Setting up monitoring and alerting

## Next Steps
- Deploy to staging environment
- Monitor cost metrics for a few days
- Gather feedback and make adjustments as needed
- Deploy to production environment
