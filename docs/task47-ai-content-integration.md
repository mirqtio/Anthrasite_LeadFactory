# Task 47: Integrate AI Content with Email Template

## Implementation Summary

Task 47 has been successfully implemented to integrate AI-powered content generation into the email template system.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AI Content Generator Module (`leadfactory/email/ai_content_generator.py`)
- **AIContentGenerator** class that uses LLM to generate:
  - Personalized improvement suggestions based on business data and scores
  - Custom introduction paragraphs
  - Compelling calls-to-action
- **EmailContentPersonalizer** orchestrator that coordinates all AI content generation
- Fallback mechanisms for when AI is unavailable

### 2. Email Queue Integration
- Modified `leadfactory/pipeline/email_queue.py` to:
  - Make email generation async to support AI calls
  - Check `USE_AI_EMAIL_CONTENT` environment variable
  - Integrate AI-generated content into email templates
  - Maintain backward compatibility with standard generation

### 3. Features
- **Vertical-specific improvements**: Different suggestions for HVAC, plumbing, electrical, etc.
- **Score-based prioritization**: Low-scoring areas get prioritized improvements
- **Personalized content**: Intro paragraphs mention location and business details
- **Smart fallbacks**: Uses template-based content if AI fails

## Configuration

Enable/disable AI content generation:
```bash
# Enable AI content (default)
export USE_AI_EMAIL_CONTENT=true

# Disable AI content
export USE_AI_EMAIL_CONTENT=false
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests (`tests/unit/email/test_ai_content_generator.py`)
- ✅ AI improvement generation with mocked LLM
- ✅ Fallback when AI fails
- ✅ Personalized intro generation
- ✅ Call-to-action generation
- ✅ Vertical-specific defaults
- ✅ Score-based prioritization
- ✅ Full email personalization flow
- ✅ Subject line generation
- ✅ Content injection into templates

### Integration Tests (`tests/integration/test_email_ai_content_integration.py`)

- Tests fallback mechanisms
- Tests different business verticals

## Example Output
