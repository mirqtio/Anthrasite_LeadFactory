# Scalable Architecture Implementation Plan - Task #13

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for Task #13: Implement Scalable Architecture for High-Volume Lead Processing. The goal is to achieve 10x current capacity (1,000 leads/minute) while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Current State Analysis

### Architecture Overview
- **Pipeline**: Sequential 6-stage processing (scrape → enrich → dedupe → score → mockup → email)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with basic abstraction layer
- **Performance**: 100 leads/minute target, 10,000 leads in 180 minutes
- **Containerization**: Basic Docker setup, no orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana setup exists

### Identified Bottlenecks
1. **Sequential Processing**: No parallel execution between pipeline stages
2. **Single Database**: No sharding, limited read replicas
3. **API Rate Limits**: External dependencies limit throughput
4. **Memory Constraints**: Heavy AI operations (Ollama, GPT-4o)
5. **No Horizontal Scaling**: No container orchestration
6. **Limited Caching**: No distributed cache for hot data

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
#### 1.1 Enhanced Containerization
- Create production-ready Dockerfiles for all services
- Implement health checks and graceful shutdowns
- Configure resource limits and requests
- Multi-stage builds for optimized images

#### 1.2 Service Decomposition
- Split monolithic pipeline into microservices:
  - `scraper-service`: Handles lead scraping
  - `enrichment-service`: Business data enrichment
  - `deduplication-service`: Ollama-based deduplication
  - `scoring-service`: YAML rule evaluation
  - `mockup-service`: AI-generated mockups
  - `email-service`: SendGrid integration
  - `api-gateway`: Request routing and rate limiting

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Weeks 3-4)
#### 2.1 Message Queue Implementation
- Deploy Apache Kafka cluster
- Design topic strategy:
  - `leads.scraped`: New leads from scraping
  - `leads.enriched`: Enriched business data
  - `leads.deduplicated`: Processed leads
  - `leads.scored`: Scored leads
  - `mockups.requested`: Mockup generation requests
  - `emails.queued`: Email dispatch requests

#### 2.2 Database Optimization
- Implement PostgreSQL sharding by geography/source
- Set up read replicas for high-volume queries
- Implement connection pooling (PgBouncer)
- Optimize indexes based on query patterns

#### 2.3 Distributed Caching
- Deploy Redis cluster with persistence
- Cache strategies:
  - Lead data (30min TTL)
  - Scoring rules (24hr TTL)
  - API responses (varies by source)
  - Deduplication vectors (7 days TTL)

### Phase 3: Orchestration (Weeks 5-6)
#### 3.1 Kubernetes Deployment
- Configure K8s cluster with appropriate node pools
- Implement horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA)
- Set up ingress controllers with load balancing
- Configure persistent volumes for stateful services

#### 3.2 Auto-scaling Configuration
- CPU/Memory-based scaling for compute services
- Queue depth-based scaling for processing services
- Maintain 3x t3.medium Puppeteer containers (always running)
- GPU burst capability via Hetzner (queue > 2k leads)

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Testing (Weeks 7-8)
#### 4.1 Observability Implementation
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Enhanced Prometheus metrics
- Grafana dashboards for microservices
- Structured logging with correlation IDs

#### 4.2 Performance Testing Framework
- Load testing scripts (JMeter/Locust)
- Automated performance regression tests
- Chaos engineering for resilience testing
- CI/CD integration for continuous testing

## Performance Targets

### Throughput Requirements
- **Current**: 100 leads/minute
- **Target**: 1,000 leads/minute (10x improvement)
- **Peak**: 1,500 leads/minute (burst capacity)

### Latency Requirements
- **Pipeline Stage**: < 5 seconds per stage
- **End-to-End**: < 30 seconds for complete processing
- **API Response**: < 100ms for synchronous endpoints

### Availability Requirements
- **Uptime**: 99.9% availability
- **Recovery**: < 5 minutes for component failures
- **Data Loss**: Zero tolerance for lead data

## Resource Planning

### Compute Requirements
- **Base Load**: 6 services × 2 replicas × 1 CPU = 12 CPU cores
- **Peak Load**: 6 services × 5 replicas × 1 CPU = 30 CPU cores
- **GPU Burst**: Hetzner GPU instances for personalization queue > 2k
- **Memory**: 4GB per service instance (24GB base, 60GB peak)

### Storage Requirements
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database with 3 read replicas
- **Redis**: 16GB cluster for distributed caching
- **Kafka**: 3-node cluster with 1TB storage per node
- **Persistent Volumes**: 100GB per stateful service

### Network Requirements
- **Internal**: 10Gbps between services
- **External**: 1Gbps for API calls and email delivery
- **Load Balancer**: L7 load balancing with SSL termination

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **API Rate Limits**: Implement rate limiting and backoff strategies
2. **Data Consistency**: Use distributed transactions where necessary
3. **Service Dependencies**: Implement circuit breakers and fallbacks
4. **Resource Contention**: Proper resource isolation and limits

### Operational Risks
1. **Deployment Complexity**: Blue-green deployments for zero downtime
2. **Monitoring Gaps**: Comprehensive alerting for all critical metrics
3. **Data Migration**: Careful migration strategy for existing data
4. **Team Knowledge**: Documentation and training for new architecture

## Success Metrics

### Performance Metrics
- Throughput: 1,000 leads/minute sustained
- Latency: 95th percentile < 30 seconds end-to-end
- Error Rate: < 0.5% across all services

### Reliability Metrics
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
