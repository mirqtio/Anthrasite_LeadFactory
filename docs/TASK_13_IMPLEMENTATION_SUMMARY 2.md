- **Query Optimization**: Smart shard routing to minimize cross-shard queries

### ✅ Infrastructure Components
- **Message Queues**: Apache Kafka for asynchronous processing
- **Distributed Caching**: Redis cluster for hot data caching
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger for observability
- **Auto-scaling**: HPA based on CPU, memory, and queue depth metrics

### ✅ Performance Testing
- **Load Testing Framework**: Comprehensive async load testing with configurable parameters
- **Integration Tests**: Docker Compose-based service integration testing
- **Performance Targets**: 1,000 RPS capability with <1% error rate

## 🏗️ Architecture Components

### Microservices
1. **Scraper Service** (`/api/scrape`) - Business data collection
2. **Enrichment Service** (`/api/enrich`) - Website analysis and tech stack detection
3. **Deduplication Service** (`/api/dedupe`) - Ollama-powered duplicate detection
4. **Scoring Service** (`/api/score`) - YAML rule-based business scoring
5. **Mockup Service** (`/api/mockup`) - GPU-accelerated AI mockup generation
6. **Email Service** (`/api/email`) - SendGrid integration for outreach

### Infrastructure Services
- **API Gateway**: NGINX with rate limiting and load balancing
- **PostgreSQL Cluster**: Sharded primary databases with read replicas
- **Redis Cluster**: Distributed caching with TTL policies
- **Kafka Cluster**: Message queuing with topic partitioning
- **Monitoring Stack**: Complete observability suite
