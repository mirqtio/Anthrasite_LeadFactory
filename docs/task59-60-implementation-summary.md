# Tasks 59 & 60: Implementation Summary

## Task 59: Auto-Monitor Bounce Rate & IP Warmup
**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details
- **Bounce Monitor**: `leadfactory/services/bounce_monitor.py`
  - Tracks bounce rates per IP/subuser
  - Configurable thresholds (default 2% for switching)
  - Real-time calculation with rolling window

- **IP Pool Switching**: `leadfactory/services/ip_pool_switching_integration.py`
  - Automatic switching when bounce rate exceeds 2%
  - Priority-based pool management (primary, backup, emergency)
  - Integration with bounce monitor

- **SendGrid Warmup**: `leadfactory/email/sendgrid_warmup.py`
  - 14-day warmup schedule with 7 stages
  - Progressive send limits (5K â†’ 110K emails/day)
  - Automatic pausing on threshold breach

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/services/test_bounce_rate_monitor.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_bounce_monitoring_integration.py`
- IP pool switching tests: `tests/integration/test_ip_pool_switching.py`

### Configuration
```bash
BOUNCE_RATE_WARNING_THRESHOLD=0.02
BOUNCE_RATE_CRITICAL_THRESHOLD=0.05
ENABLE_AUTO_IP_SWITCHING=true
```

## Task 60: Enforce Per-Service Daily Cost Caps
**Status: COMPLETED**

### Implementation Details
- **Core Module**: `leadfactory/cost/per_service_cost_caps.py`
  - Service-specific daily limits via environment variables
  - Support for OpenAI, SEMrush, Screenshot, GPU, SendGrid
  - Warning (80%) and critical (90%) thresholds

- **Decorators**: `leadfactory/cost/service_cost_decorators.py`
  - `@enforce_service_cost_cap()` - Enforces caps before execution
  - `@track_service_cost()` - Tracks without enforcement
  - Service-specific decorators: `@openai_cost_cap()`, `@semrush_cost_cap()`

### Environment Variables
```bash
OPENAI_DAILY_CAP=20.0     # Default $20/day
SEMRUSH_DAILY_CAP=5.0     # Default $5/day
SCREENSHOT_DAILY_CAP=2.0   # Default $2/day
GPU_DAILY_CAP=10.0        # Default $10/day
SENDGRID_DAILY_CAP=1.0    # Default $1/day
ENFORCE_SERVICE_COST_CAPS=true
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: `tests/unit/cost/test_per_service_cost_caps.py`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_per_service_cost_caps_integration.py`

### Features
- Real-time cost tracking and enforcement
- Status reporting (AVAILABLE, WARNING, CRITICAL, CAPPED)
- Capacity estimation and reporting
- Manual override capabilities
- Exception handling with `ServiceCostCapExceeded`

## Summary
Both tasks have been fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage. Task 59 provides robust bounce rate monitoring with automatic IP pool switching and warmup capabilities. Task 60 delivers a sophisticated per-service cost cap system that exceeds the original requirements with additional features like warning thresholds and status monitoring.
