# Implementation Summary - May 2025

This document summarizes the implementation of all items from the execution checklist to ensure the Anthrasite LeadFactory platform is in a "spec-clean, alert-green" state before scaling volumes.

## 1. Backup & Durability Hardening

### 1.1 Extended DB-dump Retention
- ✅ Updated `rsync_backup.sh` to keep 90 days of daily dumps

- ✅ Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/deployment.md`
- ✅ Implemented scripts for backup and restore operations

### 1.3 Supabase Storage Mirroring
- ✅ Created `scripts/mirror_supabase_storage.py` to pull storage objects
- ✅ Implemented automatic verification of mirrored images
- ✅ Added retention management for mirrored storage

## 2. Monitoring / Alert Completeness

### 2.1 Bounce & Spam Prometheus Metrics
- ✅ Enhanced `bin/metrics.py` with email metrics gauges
- ✅ Updated `bin/email/sendgrid_email_sender.py` to update metrics after each send
- ✅ Added automatic metrics collection thread

### 2.2 Cost-per-lead Metric & Alert
- ✅ Implemented `bin/cost_tracking.py` with comprehensive cost tracking
- ✅ Added tier-specific thresholds for cost-per-lead alerts
- ✅ Integrated with batch processing to calculate metrics at end of each batch

### 2.3 GPU-burst Spend Tracking
- ✅ Added GPU cost tracking to `bin/cost_tracking.py`
- ✅ Implemented hourly rate calculation and daily cost accumulation
- ✅ Exposed `leadfactory_gpu_cost_daily` gauge for alerting

### 2.4 Pipeline-finished-by-05:00 Metric
- ✅ Updated `scripts/run_nightly.sh` to record completion timestamp
- ✅ Added `leadfactory_batch_completed_timestamp` metric
- ✅ Implemented automatic alerting for late pipeline completion

### 2.5 Supabase Tier / Usage Check
- ✅ Created `scripts/monitor_supabase_usage.py` to check disk and row usage
- ✅ Added `supabase_storage_mb` gauge and alert at 80% of free tier
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive usage reporting

## 3. Budget Gate Automation

### 3.1 Wire Scaling-gate into Expensive Stages
- ✅ Implemented `bin/budget_gate.py` with configurable thresholds
- ✅ Added `@budget_gated` decorator for expensive operations
- ✅ Integrated with GPT/Claude and SEMrush calls in `bin/enrich_with_retention.py`
- ✅ Added logging of `SKIPPED_DUE_TO_BUDGET` events
- ✅ Created unit tests to verify gate functionality

## 4. Raw-data Retention

### 4.1 Save Compressed Homepage HTML
- ✅ Implemented `bin/data_retention.py` for managing raw data
- ✅ Updated `bin/enrich_with_retention.py` to store gzipped HTML in Supabase Storage
- ✅ Added 90-day retention period with automatic cleanup

### 4.2 Persist LLM Prompts & Completions
- ✅ Created `llm_logs` table schema in `bin/data_retention.py`
- ✅ Implemented logging of all GPT-4/Claude calls with costs
- ✅ Added retention management respecting `expires_at` field

## 5. Fail-over Drill & Threshold Tweak

### 5.1 Set `HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURES_THRESHOLD=2`
- ✅ Updated `.env.production` with new threshold value
- ✅ Implemented in `bin/health_check.py` with proper failure counting

### 5.2 Run Controlled Failover Test
- ✅ Conducted failover test by stopping Docker on primary
- ✅ Verified health-check triggered backup VPS activation
- ✅ Documented results in `docs/failover-test-2025-05.md`

## 6. Pre-commit & Static Analysis

### 6.1 Add Pre-commit Config
- ✅ Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with required hooks:
  - ✅ ruff for linting
  - ✅ bandit for security checks
  - ✅ black for code formatting
  - ✅ detect-secrets for sensitive information detection
- ✅ Added `.secrets.baseline` file for detect-secrets
- ✅ Created CI job in `.github/workflows/pre-commit-ci.yml`

### 6.2 Document Dev Workflow
- ✅ Created comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md` with development workflow
- ✅ Documented pre-commit hooks, testing process, and PR workflow
- ✅ Added clear instructions for local development setup

## Verification

All implemented changes have been verified through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Added tests for all new functionality
2. **Integration Tests**: Verified interactions between components
3. **CI Pipeline**: Ensured all changes pass the CI pipeline
4. **Manual Testing**: Performed manual verification of critical components

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Alert Performance**: Observe the behavior of new alerts in production
2. **Schedule Regular Failover Drills**: Plan quarterly tests to ensure continued reliability
3. **Review Cost Metrics**: Analyze cost-per-lead metrics to identify optimization opportunities
4. **Update Documentation**: Keep documentation in sync with any future changes

## Conclusion

All items from the execution checklist have been successfully implemented, creating significant leverage through:

1. **Improved Durability**: Enhanced backup and recovery capabilities
2. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Added metrics for all critical aspects
3. **Cost Control**: Implemented budget gates and tracking
4. **Data Retention**: Ensured proper storage of raw data
5. **High Availability**: Verified failover capabilities
6. **Development Workflow**: Streamlined the development process

The platform is now in a "spec-clean, alert-green" state and ready for scaling volumes.
