# Task ID: 18
# Title: Fix Static Code Analysis Issues
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: high
# Description: Address remaining linting and static code analysis issues before merging to main
# Details:
Fix the remaining code quality issues identified by flake8 and ruff, including:
1. Undefined variables in test_enrich.py
2. Unused variable assignments in test files
3. Function redefinition issues
4. Import order problems
5. Any remaining PEP8 violations

These issues need to be fixed before merging to the main branch to ensure code quality standards are maintained.

# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Fix Undefined Variables in test_enrich.py [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Address all undefined variable issues identified by static code analysis tools in test_enrich.py file.
### Details:
1. Run flake8 and ruff specifically on test_enrich.py to identify all undefined variables
2. For each undefined variable, either define it properly or import it from the appropriate module
3. Ensure all test functions have proper variable scoping
4. Verify that all assertions use properly defined variables
5. Document any intentional variable usage patterns that might trigger false positives

## 2. Remove Unused Variable Assignments in Test Files [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and eliminate all unused variable assignments across test files to improve code cleanliness.
### Details:
1. Run static analysis tools to identify all unused variable assignments in test files
2. For each unused variable, determine if it can be safely removed
3. If the variable is needed for clarity but not used, prefix with underscore (_) to indicate intentional non-use
4. Remove any test setup code that creates variables never referenced
5. Check for and fix any test assertions that don't actually use their computed values

## 3. Resolve Function Redefinition Issues [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix all instances where functions are redefined within the same scope, causing potential confusion and code quality issues.
### Details:
1. Identify all function redefinition warnings from static analysis tools
2. For each redefinition, determine if it's intentional or accidental
3. Rename functions with unique names if both implementations are needed
4. Remove duplicate function definitions if they're redundant
5. Consider refactoring to use class inheritance or composition instead of function redefinition
6. Check for test helper functions that might be redefined across test files and move to common utilities

## 4. Fix Import Order Problems [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Correct all import statements to follow the project's import order conventions and PEP8 guidelines.
### Details:
1. Review the project's import order conventions (typically: standard library, third-party, local imports)
2. Run isort or similar tool to automatically fix most import order issues
3. Manually review and fix any remaining import order problems
4. Ensure imports are grouped properly with appropriate spacing between groups
5. Remove any unused imports identified during analysis
6. Fix any wildcard imports (from module import *) by explicitly importing only what's needed

## 5. Address Remaining PEP8 Violations [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Fix any other PEP8 style violations not covered by the previous subtasks to ensure full code quality compliance.
### Details:
1. Run flake8 with PEP8 checking enabled to identify all remaining style issues
2. Fix line length violations by breaking long lines appropriately
3. Correct indentation issues throughout the codebase
4. Fix whitespace issues (trailing whitespace, missing whitespace around operators)
5. Ensure proper naming conventions for variables, functions, and classes
6. Address any other style issues reported by the tools
