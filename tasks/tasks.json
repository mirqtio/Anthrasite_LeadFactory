      "details": "This task involves creating a robust execution and resolution framework for the E2E pipeline that continuously improves system reliability:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration and Validation**:\n   - Load '.env.e2e' configuration and verify EMAIL_OVERRIDE and real API keys are present\n   - Run 'bin/e2e_validate_config.py' preflight check before execution\n   - If preflight fails, abort and create a new task titled \"Fix E2E Preflight Failure: <summary>\"\n\n2. **Automated Execution Framework**:\n   - Develop a scheduled execution system that runs the full E2E pipeline at configurable intervals (hourly, daily, etc.)\n   - Implement a command-line interface: `bin/run_e2e_pipeline.py --mode=[scheduled|manual] --notify=[slack|email|both]`\n   - Execute the complete BDD scenario with real API keys, mockup generation, and email delivery using EMAIL_OVERRIDE\n\n3. **Validation and Verification**:\n   - Validate the end-to-end lead processing and email delivery\n   - Confirm screenshot and mockup creation\n   - Verify email sent via SendGrid (response 202)\n   - Check DB contains new 'emails' row\n\n4. **Failure Detection and Classification**:\n   - Build a failure analysis module that categorizes issues by type (API failure, data validation error, timeout, etc.)\n   - Implement intelligent diff comparison between successful and failed runs to isolate changed components\n   - Create a historical failure database to track recurring issues and their resolutions\n\n5. **Resolution Workflow**:\n   - If the test fails, write detailed error logs\n   - Auto-create task titled \"Fix E2E Test Failure: <summary>\"\n   - Retry once the fix task is complete\n   - Develop an automated ticketing integration that creates JIRA/GitHub issues for new failures with all relevant context\n   - Implement a \"known issues\" registry that maps failure signatures to documented solutions\n\n6. **Reporting and Documentation**:\n   - Write summary to 'e2e_summary.md' with:\n     - Lead ID\n     - Screenshot/mockup paths\n     - SendGrid message ID\n     - API costs\n   - Create a metrics dashboard showing pipeline health over time\n   - Generate monthly reports highlighting systemic issues\n\n7. **Continuous Improvement Loop**:\n   - Implement a feedback mechanism where resolved issues automatically update the known issues registry\n   - Connect with the preflight check system to prevent execution when prerequisites aren't met\n   - Utilize the PostgreSQL database for storing execution history and failure patterns\n\n8. **Notification and Alerting**:\n   - Implement configurable alerting thresholds for different failure types\n   - Create role-based notifications (developers for code issues, DevOps for infrastructure problems)\n   - Develop a daily digest email summarizing pipeline health and outstanding issues\n\nThis task is only considered complete when:\n- Preflight passes\n- BDD test passes\n- Email is verifiably delivered to EMAIL_OVERRIDE\n- 'e2e_summary.md' is present and complete",
      "testStrategy": "The implementation will be verified through the following testing approach:\n\n1. **Preflight Validation**:\n   - Verify the system correctly loads '.env.e2e' and validates required environment variables\n   - Confirm preflight checks abort execution when prerequisites aren't met\n   - Test the automatic creation of fix tasks when preflight fails\n\n2. **Functional Testing**:\n   - Verify the automated execution system correctly runs the E2E pipeline at scheduled intervals\n   - Confirm the BDD scenario executes completely with real API keys and EMAIL_OVERRIDE\n   - Validate that screenshots, mockups, and emails are properly generated\n   - Test that the DB correctly records new email entries\n   - Confirm the failure detection system correctly categorizes at least 10 different types of injected failures\n\n3. **Integration Testing**:\n   - Validate proper integration with the preflight check system, confirming the pipeline doesn't run when prerequisites fail\n   - Test database connectivity by verifying execution history is properly stored and retrievable\n   - Confirm notification systems deliver alerts to the correct channels based on failure type\n\n4. **Output Validation**:\n   - Verify 'e2e_summary.md' contains all required information (Lead ID, paths, message ID, costs)\n   - Confirm emails are actually delivered to the EMAIL_OVERRIDE address\n   - Validate SendGrid returns 202 response codes for successful sends\n\n5. **Resolution Testing**:\n   - Test the resolution workflow by introducing known issues and verifying correct ticket creation\n   - Confirm the system properly retries after fixes are implemented\n   - Verify the known issues registry is updated after successful resolutions\n\n6. **Performance and Reliability Testing**:\n   - Measure overhead introduced by the monitoring framework (should be <5% of total execution time)\n   - Run a 7-day continuous operation test with intentionally introduced failures\n   - Verify the system recovers properly from infrastructure outages\n\n7. **Acceptance Criteria**:\n   - System successfully detects and categorizes >95% of introduced failures\n   - Resolution suggestions resolve >70% of common issues without developer intervention\n   - Pipeline health metrics show improvement trend over time with automatic resolution\n   - All notifications are delivered within 2 minutes of failure detection\n   - Email is verifiably delivered to EMAIL_OVERRIDE address\n   - Complete 'e2e_summary.md' is generated for each successful run",
