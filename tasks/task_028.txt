# Task ID: 28
# Title: Task #28: Web Interface for HTML and LLM Logs Browsing
# Status: deferred
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a user-friendly web interface that allows users to browse, search, filter, and export stored HTML and LLM logs, enhancing the raw data retention features by providing easy access to historical data.
# Details:
This task involves creating a web-based interface for accessing the HTML and LLM logs stored as part of the Raw Data Retention Implementation (Task #22). The implementation should:

1. Create a responsive web interface using appropriate frontend frameworks (e.g., React, Vue.js)
2. Implement backend API endpoints to query and retrieve log data
3. Develop filtering capabilities by:
   - Date range (from/to)
   - Business ID
   - Request type
   - Response status
   - Content type (HTML/LLM)
4. Include pagination for handling large datasets efficiently
5. Implement search functionality to find specific content within logs
6. Add data export features in common formats (CSV, JSON)
7. Ensure proper authentication and authorization to protect sensitive log data
8. Include data visualization components for basic analytics (e.g., request volume over time)
9. Implement responsive design for both desktop and mobile access
10. Add user preferences for default views and filters

The implementation should follow the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) and ensure that the interface is intuitive and performs well even with large log datasets. Consider implementing caching strategies to improve performance when querying frequently accessed logs.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for this feature should include:

1. Unit tests:
   - Test all API endpoints for retrieving and filtering log data
   - Verify correct implementation of search algorithms
   - Test data export functionality for accuracy and completeness

2. Integration tests:
   - Verify the web interface correctly communicates with the backend
   - Test that filters correctly narrow down the dataset
   - Ensure pagination works correctly with various page sizes

3. Performance tests:
   - Benchmark load times with various dataset sizes
   - Test response times for complex filter combinations
   - Verify export functionality performs adequately with large datasets

4. UI/UX tests:
   - Conduct usability testing with potential users
   - Verify responsive design works across different devices and screen sizes
   - Test accessibility compliance using automated tools

5. Security tests:
   - Verify authentication and authorization controls
   - Test for common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
   - Ensure sensitive log data is properly protected

6. Acceptance criteria:
   - Users can successfully filter logs by all specified criteria
   - Search functionality returns relevant results
   - Exports contain all selected data in the correct format
   - Interface is responsive and loads within acceptable time limits
   - All features work in supported browsers

Document test results and any performance metrics as part of the task completion.
