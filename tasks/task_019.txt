# Task ID: 19
# Title: Email Deliverability Hardening
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement email deliverability improvements to reduce bounce rates, track spam complaints, and add metrics
# Details:
Implement the following email deliverability hardening features:

1. Lower the bounce threshold to 2% (last 7 days) before any send
2. Implement automatic IP/sub-user switching when bounce > 2%
3. Add spam-rate tracking via SendGrid stats
4. Add Prometheus metrics and Grafana alerts for bounce and spam rates
5. Create BDD tests for high-bounce and spam complaint scenarios

These improvements are critical for maintaining email deliverability and compliance with email sending best practices.

# Test Strategy:
All code changes must follow the standard workflow for development, testing, quality assurance, pre-commit checks, and CI verification before being considered complete. Refer to the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) for the complete process that must be followed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Lower bounce threshold to 2% for email sends [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Modify the email sending system to check bounce rates over the last 7 days and prevent sends when the rate exceeds 2%
### Details:
1. Update the pre-send validation logic to query bounce rates for the last 7 days
2. Implement a threshold check of 2% maximum bounce rate
3. Create a blocking mechanism that prevents sends when threshold is exceeded
4. Add appropriate error messaging for marketing users
5. Document the new threshold in the email sending guidelines

## 2. Implement automatic IP/sub-user switching mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Develop a system that automatically switches to alternative IPs or sub-users when bounce rates exceed 2%
### Details:
1. Create a pool of alternative IPs and sub-users in SendGrid
2. Develop logic to automatically select the next available IP/sub-user when bounce threshold is exceeded
3. Implement a rotation strategy that considers IP warming and reputation
4. Add logging for IP/sub-user switches
5. Create a recovery mechanism to return to primary IPs when bounce rates normalize

## 3. Add spam-rate tracking via SendGrid stats [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate with SendGrid's statistics API to track and store spam complaint rates for all email campaigns
### Details:
1. Set up regular polling of SendGrid stats API for spam complaint data
2. Create a database schema to store historical spam rate data
3. Implement an aggregation mechanism for calculating spam rates across different time periods
4. Add an admin dashboard view to display current and historical spam rates
5. Document the spam rate tracking methodology for the team

## 4. Add Prometheus metrics and Grafana alerts [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3
### Description: Implement monitoring for bounce and spam rates using Prometheus metrics and set up Grafana alerts for threshold violations
### Details:
1. Define and expose Prometheus metrics for bounce rates and spam complaint rates
2. Configure metric collection intervals and retention policies
3. Create Grafana dashboards to visualize bounce and spam rate trends
4. Set up alert rules for when rates approach or exceed thresholds
5. Configure alert notifications via appropriate channels (Slack, email, PagerDuty)

## 5. Create BDD tests for high-bounce and spam complaint scenarios [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Develop behavior-driven development tests that validate the system's response to high bounce rates and spam complaints
### Details:
1. Define Gherkin scenarios for high bounce rate detection and handling
2. Create scenarios for spam complaint tracking and alerting
3. Implement step definitions that simulate SendGrid API responses
4. Add scenarios for IP/sub-user switching under high bounce conditions
5. Create end-to-end tests that verify the complete workflow from detection to alerting

## 6. Configure Environment Variables and Alert Rules [done]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3, 19.4
### Description: Set explicit environment variables and create alert rules for bounce and spam rates
### Details:
1. Set BOUNCE_RATE_THRESHOLD=0.02 in environment configuration
2. Set MONTHLY_BUDGET=250 in environment configuration
3. Create BounceHigh alert rule (warning ≥ 1%, critical ≥ 2%)
4. Create SpamHigh alert rule (warning ≥ 0.05%, critical ≥ 0.1%)
5. Document all environment variables and alert rules in the project documentation
6. Ensure CI pipeline uses these environment variables for testing
