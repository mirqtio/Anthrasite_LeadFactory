### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:17:53.095Z>
The website scraping logic for tech stack identification has been implemented with the following components:

1. Created a TechStackAnalyzer class that leverages Wappalyzer for technology detection on target websites
2. Enhanced detection capabilities with manual checks for common technologies like jQuery and Bootstrap that might be missed by automated tools
3. Added functionality to identify outdated HTML/CSS elements to help assess technical debt
4. Implemented responsive design detection to evaluate mobile-friendliness of target websites
5. Built comprehensive error handling with specific exception types for different failure scenarios
6. Integrated structured logging for all operations to facilitate debugging and monitoring
7. Applied appropriate timeouts to all network operations to prevent hanging during scraping

The implementation adheres to the Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, ensuring robust error handling, appropriate logging levels, and explicit timeouts for all network operations. The code is now ready for integration with the lead enrichment pipeline.

### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:18:21.446Z>
The PageSpeed API integration has been successfully implemented to fetch Core Web Vitals data. The implementation includes:

1. A PageSpeedAnalyzer class that handles all interactions with the Google PageSpeed Insights API
2. Extraction of key Core Web Vitals metrics:
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP)
   - Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
   - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
   - Total Blocking Time (TBT)
   - Speed Index
   - Time to Interactive
3. Performance score calculation functionality to assess overall site health
4. Additional metrics extraction including accessibility, best practices, and SEO scores
5. API usage cost tracking to monitor consumption
6. Comprehensive error handling with appropriate exception management
7. Configurable timeout settings for all network operations
8. Response validation and parsing to ensure data integrity

The implementation adheres to the Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, featuring robust error handling mechanisms, appropriate logging throughout the code, and explicit timeouts for all network operations to prevent hanging requests.

## 3. Implement tier-based enrichment logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create conditional logic for tier-based enrichment features
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:18:52.651Z>
The tier-based enrichment logic has been implemented with a scalable approach that activates different features based on the configured tier level (1, 2, or 3):

Tier 1 (Basic):
- Implemented core tech stack analysis functionality
- Integrated PageSpeed metrics from the previously implemented PageSpeed API
- Optimized for minimal API costs while providing essential insights

Tier 2 (Standard):
- Includes all Tier 1 features
- Added website screenshot capture functionality using ScreenshotOne API
- Implemented proper error handling for screenshot failures
- Added caching to prevent redundant API calls

Tier 3 (Premium):
- Includes all Tier 1 and Tier 2 features
- Integrated with SEMrush Site Audit API for comprehensive site analysis
- Implemented detailed reporting for premium insights

Additional Implementation Details:
- Created a cost tracking system to monitor API usage expenses for each tier
- Added configuration via environment variables to set the default tier level
- Implemented command-line override option for tier selection
- Ensured robust error handling for all tier-specific features
- Applied Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1 compliance throughout the code
- Implemented appropriate logging at each enrichment step
- Added explicit timeouts for all network operations to prevent hanging

The implementation ensures cost-effective operation by default while allowing for premium features when needed. The modular design makes it easy to add new enrichment features to any tier in the future.

## 4. Implement database integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions to fetch businesses and save enrichment data
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:19:21.170Z>
The database integration for the enrichment script has been implemented with the following components:

1. Created get_businesses_to_enrich function to fetch businesses requiring enrichment from the database
2. Implemented filtering logic to only process businesses with websites and no existing features
3. Developed save_features function to store enrichment data in the database
4. Added transaction handling to ensure data integrity during database operations
5. Implemented parameterized queries as a security measure against SQL injection
6. Added command-line filtering options (--limit, --id) for more flexible data processing
7. Implemented comprehensive error handling for all database operations
8. Added structured logging to track database operations

The implementation follows Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1 standards, ensuring robust error handling, appropriate logging levels, and database security best practices. The database integration creates a seamless data flow between the scraping phase and the enrichment process, maintaining data integrity throughout the pipeline.

## 5. Implement parallel processing [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create concurrent execution logic for efficient enrichment
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:19:49.483Z>
The parallel processing implementation for the enrichment script has been completed with the following components:

1. ThreadPoolExecutor implementation for concurrent business enrichment operations, allowing multiple enrichment requests to be processed simultaneously.

2. Configurable MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS parameter that can be set via environment variable, providing flexibility to adjust concurrency based on system capabilities and API rate limits.

3. Task submission and result collection logic that properly manages the concurrent execution flow and aggregates results from parallel operations.

4. Progress tracking system that monitors and reports on completed and failed enrichment operations in real-time.

5. Exception handling specifically designed for parallel tasks, ensuring that failures in individual enrichment operations don't affect the entire batch.

6. Timeout configuration to prevent hanging operations, ensuring that long-running or stalled requests don't block the entire process.

7. Resource management implementation to prevent system overload, including proper thread management and resource cleanup.

8. Detailed logging for monitoring parallel execution, providing visibility into the enrichment process performance.

The implementation adheres to the Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, featuring robust error handling, appropriate logging levels, and explicit timeouts for all network operations. The parallel processing architecture significantly improves throughput for the enrichment stage compared to sequential processing.
