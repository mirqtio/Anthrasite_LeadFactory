# Task ID: 22
# Title: Raw Data Retention Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement raw data retention for scraped HTML and LLM interactions to meet compliance requirements
# Details:
Implement the following raw data retention features:

1. Persist raw HTML of each scraped homepage (compressed) and store the path in the database
2. Log LLM prompt and response JSON (for deduplication and mockup generation) in a new `llm_logs` table
3. Ensure no data cleanup occurs for at least 90 days (document retention policy)
4. Add documentation for the data retention policy and implementation

These features will ensure compliance with data retention requirements and provide an audit trail for system operations.

# Test Strategy:
All code changes must follow the standard workflow for development, testing, quality assurance, pre-commit checks, and CI verification before being considered complete. Refer to the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) for the complete process.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement HTML Storage for Scraped Homepages [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to compress and store raw HTML from scraped homepages and record the storage path in the database
### Details:
1. Implement compression algorithm for HTML content
2. Create storage directory structure with appropriate permissions
3. Modify scraper to save compressed HTML after each successful scrape
4. Add database column to store file path reference
5. Update existing code to record file paths for each scrape
6. Implement error handling for storage failures

## 2. Create LLM Logging System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a logging system to record all LLM prompts and responses in a new database table
### Details:
1. Create new `llm_logs` table with appropriate schema (timestamp, user_id, prompt_text, response_json, model_version, etc.)
2. Implement logging middleware to capture all LLM interactions
3. Add indexing for efficient querying
4. Ensure proper JSON serialization/deserialization
5. Add metadata fields for deduplication purposes
6. Implement query interface for audit purposes

## 3. Implement 90-Day Retention Policy [done]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Configure data retention mechanisms to ensure all raw data is preserved for at least 90 days and document the implementation
### Details:
1. Create retention policy configuration in system settings
2. Implement scheduled job to identify but not delete data older than 90 days
3. Add warning system for approaching deletion dates
4. Create admin interface for retention policy management
5. Write comprehensive documentation covering data retention implementation
6. Document compliance aspects and audit procedures
7. Add data export functionality for records prior to potential deletion
