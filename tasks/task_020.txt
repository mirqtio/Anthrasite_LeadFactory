# Task ID: 20
# Title: CAN-SPAM Compliance Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Add required CAN-SPAM compliance elements to email templates and implement unsubscribe functionality
# Details:
Implement the following CAN-SPAM compliance features:

1. Add physical postal address (Anthrasite PO Box) to both HTML and plain-text email templates
2. Add plain-English unsubscribe instructions and functional unsubscribe link to all email templates
3. Implement unsubscribe handling in the database to record opt-outs
4. Modify email sending logic to skip leads that have opted out
5. Create BDD tests to verify compliance elements are present in emails

These improvements are necessary for legal compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act and to maintain good sending practices.

# Test Strategy:
All code changes for CAN-SPAM compliance must follow the standard Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) for development, testing, quality assurance, pre-commit checks, and CI verification before being considered complete. This includes unit tests for template modifications, integration tests for database changes, and BDD tests for the complete unsubscribe flow.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Add Physical Postal Address to Email Templates [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add the Anthrasite PO Box address to both HTML and plain-text email templates
### Details:
Modify all email template files to include the company's physical postal address (Anthrasite PO Box) in both HTML and plain-text formats. Ensure the address is properly formatted and appears in the footer section of all templates. This is a required element for CAN-SPAM compliance.

## 2. Implement Unsubscribe Instructions and Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Add clear unsubscribe instructions and functional unsubscribe links to all email templates
### Details:
Add plain-English unsubscribe instructions and a functional unsubscribe link to all email templates. Create an unsubscribe landing page that confirms the user's opt-out request. Ensure the unsubscribe link is clearly visible and properly formatted in both HTML and plain-text emails. The unsubscribe mechanism should be simple and require no more than one step from the recipient.

## 3. Implement Database Tracking and Email Filtering for Opt-Outs [done]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Create database structure for tracking opt-outs and modify email sending logic to respect unsubscribe preferences
### Details:
Implement database schema changes to track user opt-out status. Create necessary tables or fields to record unsubscribe timestamps and status. Modify the email sending logic to check the opt-out status before sending any email, ensuring that users who have unsubscribed do not receive further communications. Implement a process to handle unsubscribe requests within 10 business days as required by CAN-SPAM.

## 4. Implement BDD Tests for Unsubscribe Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 20.2, 20.3
### Description: Create BDD tests to verify unsubscribe link works correctly and opt-out status is properly tracked in the database
### Details:
1. Create Gherkin scenarios for the unsubscribe process
2. Implement step definitions for testing unsubscribe link functionality
3. Add scenarios to verify opt-out status is correctly recorded in the database
4. Test that opted-out users are excluded from future email sends
5. Verify unsubscribe link appears correctly in both HTML and plain text emails
6. Ensure tests run against the new Postgres database

## 5. Verify Compliance with Feature Development Workflow [done]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2, 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Ensure all CAN-SPAM compliance implementations follow the standard development workflow
### Details:
Review all code changes related to CAN-SPAM compliance to ensure they adhere to the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27). This includes:
1. Proper development practices
2. Comprehensive testing at unit, integration, and BDD levels
3. Quality assurance review
4. Pre-commit checks
5. CI verification

This task serves as a final verification step before considering the CAN-SPAM compliance implementation complete.
