# Task ID: 27
# Title: Feature Development Workflow Template
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Standard workflow for developing, testing, and committing each feature
# Details:
This task defines the standard workflow that should be followed for each feature implementation:

1. **Development Phase**
   - Implement the feature according to the requirements
   - Add appropriate error handling and logging
   - Include unit tests and integration tests
   - Add or update documentation

2. **Testing Phase**
   - Run all unit tests (`pytest tests/`)
   - Run all BDD tests (`pytest tests/ --bdd`)
   - Verify code coverage meets standards
   - Perform manual testing as needed

3. **Quality Assurance Phase**
   - Run static analysis tools (ruff, bandit)
   - Run code formatting (black)
   - Fix any issues identified by the tools
   - Verify all tests still pass after fixes

4. **Pre-Commit Phase**
   - Run pre-commit hooks locally (`pre-commit run --all-files`)
   - Fix any issues identified by the hooks
   - Verify the feature works as expected after fixes

5. **Commit Phase**
   - Create a feature branch with a descriptive name
   - Commit changes with a clear message
   - Push to remote repository
   - Create a pull request with detailed description

6. **CI Verification Phase**
   - Verify CI pipeline passes
   - Address any issues identified by CI
   - Request code review if needed
   - Merge only when CI is green

This workflow should be followed for every feature to ensure consistent quality and reliability.
