# Task ID: 24
# Title: Failover Threshold Adjustment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: low
# Description: Change the HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURES_THRESHOLD to 2 consecutive failures to match the spec
# Details:
Implement the following failover tweak:

1. Change the HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURES_THRESHOLD to 2 consecutive failures (currently set to a different value)
2. Update any related documentation to reflect this change
3. Test the failover mechanism with the new threshold to ensure it works as expected

This change will align the system with the Phase 0 "Lead-Factory" spec v1.3 requirements and improve system reliability by triggering failover after fewer consecutive failures.

# Test Strategy:
All code changes must follow the standard Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) for development, testing, quality assurance, pre-commit checks, and CI verification before being considered complete.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Update HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURES_THRESHOLD Constant [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Change the HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURES_THRESHOLD constant to 2 consecutive failures and update related documentation
### Details:
1. Locate the HEALTH_CHECK_FAILURES_THRESHOLD constant in the codebase
2. Change its value from the current setting to 2 consecutive failures
3. Update any related documentation to reflect this change
4. Create a pull request with these changes
5. Reference the Phase 0 'Lead-Factory' spec v1.3 requirements in the PR description

## 2. Test Failover Mechanism with New Threshold [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Verify the failover mechanism works correctly with the new threshold of 2 consecutive failures
### Details:
1. Set up a test environment that simulates health check failures
2. Verify that failover is triggered after exactly 2 consecutive failures
3. Ensure the system recovers properly after failover
4. Document test results and any edge cases discovered
5. Verify behavior aligns with the Phase 0 'Lead-Factory' spec v1.3 requirements

## 3. Workflow Compliance Verification [done]
### Dependencies: 24.1, 24.2
### Description: Ensure all changes comply with the Feature Development Workflow Template
### Details:
1. Review all code changes to ensure they follow the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27)
2. Verify that all pre-commit checks have been executed and passed
3. Confirm that CI verification has been completed successfully
4. Ensure proper documentation of the changes in accordance with the workflow
5. Get final approval from the relevant stakeholders before closing the task
