# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Scoring Logic (04_score.py)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the fourth pipeline stage for YAML-based lead scoring
# Details:
Develop the scoring script that applies rules defined in scoring_rules.yml to calculate lead scores. Implement penalties for outdated technologies like jQuery. This task corresponds to the score_yaml task in the Next-Step Blueprint.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the scoring process correctly applies rules as specified in acceptance test F 4.1.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create scoring rules YAML file [done]
### Dependencies: None

### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:32:52.283Z>
The scoring_rules.yml file has been successfully implemented with a comprehensive set of rule definitions for lead scoring. The implementation includes:

1. Comprehensive rule definitions for lead scoring based on multiple factors, allowing for nuanced evaluation of leads
2. Tech stack rules with penalties for outdated technologies like jQuery, ensuring focus on modern tech adoption
3. Performance-based rules using Core Web Vitals metrics to prioritize leads with better site performance
4. Business category-specific scoring adjustments to tailor scoring to different industry verticals
5. Location-based scoring rules for target regions to prioritize leads in strategic geographic areas
6. Tier-specific rules for businesses with different enrichment levels, accounting for data quality
7. Multipliers for high-value verticals and perfect-match tech stacks to highlight exceptional opportunities
8. Global settings for base score, min/max scores, and high-score threshold for consistent scoring boundaries

The YAML file is structured with clear sections and descriptive comments to facilitate maintenance and future extensions. All required scoring factors from the task description have been incorporated, creating a robust framework for identifying promising leads.

## 2. Implement rule engine and scoring logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core rule evaluation and scoring system
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:34:50.769Z>
The rule engine and scoring logic implementation has been completed with the following components:

1. RuleEngine class with comprehensive condition evaluation capabilities
2. Dynamic rule loading from YAML configuration file
3. Support for all required condition types:
   - Tech stack detection with version comparison
   - Performance metrics evaluation (PageSpeed, Core Web Vitals)
   - Business category and location filtering
   - Website content analysis
   - Tier-specific condition evaluation
4. Score calculation with proper multiplier application
5. Detailed rule application tracking for transparency
6. Database integration for fetching businesses and saving scores
7. Support for recalculation mode and business ID filtering
8. Proper error handling and logging throughout

The implementation follows the Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1 specifications, with robust error handling, appropriate logging, and proper security practices. The rule engine is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new condition types in the future.

## 3. Implement database integration and CLI [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions for database operations and command-line interface
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:35:22.742Z>
The database integration and CLI implementation for the scoring script has been completed with the following components:

1. Database Integration:
   - Implemented get_businesses_to_score function with configurable parameters:
     * Limit parameter to control the number of businesses processed
     * Business ID filter for targeting specific businesses
     * Flag to enable recalculation of existing scores
   - Created save_business_score function with transaction handling to ensure data integrity
   - Added proper error handling and logging for all database operations
   - Implemented security best practices for database interactions

2. Command-Line Interface:
   - Developed an argparse-based CLI with comprehensive help text
   - Added command-line options corresponding to the database function parameters
   - Implemented proper exit code handling for different scenarios
   - Added progress tracking and summary reporting for better user experience

3. Core Functionality:
   - Implemented score_business function to coordinate the scoring process
   - Created main function with error handling and logging
   - Ensured compliance with Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1
   - Added detailed logging throughout the application

The implementation provides a flexible and robust interface for running the scoring process in various modes while ensuring proper storage of scores and applied rules in the database.
