# Task ID: 30
# Title: Task #30: Scalable Architecture Implementation for High-Volume Lead Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement a scalable architecture for the Anthrasite LeadFactory system to efficiently process increased lead volumes while maintaining performance, with the goal of handling at least 10x the current capacity without degradation.
# Details:
This task involves enhancing the LeadFactory system's architecture to support significant growth in lead processing volume. Implementation should follow these key steps:

1. Horizontal Scaling Implementation:
   - Refactor application components to be stateless where possible
   - Implement load balancing for web tier using a suitable solution (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud provider load balancer)
   - Configure auto-scaling groups based on CPU utilization, memory usage, and request queue length
   - Ensure session persistence and data consistency across scaled instances

2. Database Optimization:
   - Analyze and optimize existing database queries (add indexes, rewrite inefficient queries)
   - Implement database read replicas for scaling read operations
   - Consider database sharding strategy for write-heavy operations
   - Implement connection pooling and query caching where appropriate

3. Caching Layer Implementation:
   - Add Redis or Memcached for caching frequently accessed data
   - Implement cache invalidation strategies
   - Configure TTL (Time-To-Live) policies for different data types
   - Add monitoring for cache hit/miss rates

4. Queue-based Processing:
   - Implement message queue system (RabbitMQ, AWS SQS, etc.) for asynchronous task processing
   - Refactor lead processing workflows to utilize queue-based architecture
   - Implement retry mechanisms and dead-letter queues for failed operations
   - Create worker services that can scale independently based on queue depth

5. Auto-scaling Configuration:
   - Define appropriate scaling metrics (CPU, memory, queue depth, request latency)
   - Implement auto-scaling policies with appropriate cool-down periods
   - Set up alerts for scaling events and resource constraints
   - Document scaling thresholds and expected behavior

6. Performance Monitoring:
   - Implement comprehensive metrics collection across all system components
   - Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring of system performance
   - Configure alerting for performance degradation
   - Implement distributed tracing to identify bottlenecks

7. Documentation:
   - Update system architecture diagrams
   - Document scaling strategies and limitations
   - Create runbooks for managing scaled infrastructure
   - Document performance expectations and SLAs

This implementation should follow the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) and integrate with existing infrastructure and deployment strategies. Consider potential impacts on related systems, particularly the advanced analytics capabilities (Task #29) and the web interface for logs browsing (Task #28).

# Test Strategy:
The scalable architecture implementation should be thoroughly tested using the following approach:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual components for thread safety and concurrency handling
   - Verify proper implementation of caching mechanisms
   - Ensure queue producers and consumers handle edge cases correctly
   - Test database query optimizations for correctness

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify proper interaction between all system components
   - Test failover scenarios between scaled instances
   - Validate data consistency across distributed components
   - Ensure cache invalidation works correctly across the system

3. Load Testing:
   - Establish current system performance baseline
   - Conduct incremental load tests (2x, 5x, 10x current volume)
   - Use tools like JMeter, Locust, or k6 to simulate high lead volumes
   - Measure and record key performance metrics:
     * Response time (average, 95th percentile, 99th percentile)
     * Throughput (leads processed per second)
     * Error rates under load
     * Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network)
   - Test auto-scaling triggers and verify proper scaling behavior

4. Stress Testing:
   - Push system beyond target capacity to identify breaking points
   - Measure recovery time after overload conditions
   - Identify resource bottlenecks under extreme load

5. Chaos Testing:
   - Simulate component failures (database, cache, queue, application servers)
   - Verify system resilience and graceful degradation
   - Test recovery procedures and data consistency after failures

6. Endurance Testing:
   - Run system at 70-80% capacity for extended periods (24+ hours)
   - Monitor for memory leaks, resource exhaustion, or performance degradation
   - Verify system stability during prolonged operation

7. Acceptance Criteria:
   - System must handle 10x current lead volume with less than 20% increase in response time
   - Auto-scaling must activate appropriately based on defined metrics
   - No data loss during scaling events or component failures
   - All critical paths must have 99.9% availability during load tests
   - Database query performance must remain within defined thresholds
   - Monitoring dashboards must accurately reflect system performance

8. Documentation Verification:
   - Ensure all architectural changes are properly documented
   - Verify runbooks for managing scaled infrastructure are accurate
   - Confirm monitoring dashboards provide necessary visibility

The testing process should be automated where possible and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure ongoing performance as the system evolves.
