# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement A/B Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a framework for testing the impact of mock-ups on reply rates.
# Details:
Implement A/B testing framework:
1. Set up control (Tier-1 without mock-ups) and treatment groups (Tier-2/3 with mock-ups)
2. Implement random assignment with proper statistical power (Î± = 0.05, power = 0.80)
3. Track reply rates by variant
4. Create analysis tools for statistical significance testing

Address open questions Q1 (screenshot-based critique impact) and Q2 (statistical power adequacy). Implement proper randomization and tracking. Create reporting tools for experiment results.

# Test Strategy:
Verify random assignment produces balanced groups. Test statistical analysis with simulated reply data. Verify tracking correctly attributes replies to variants. Test with various effect sizes to validate statistical power.
