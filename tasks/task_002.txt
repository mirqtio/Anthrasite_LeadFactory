# Title: Implement Lead Scraper (01_scrape.py)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the first pipeline stage to scrape business listings from Yelp and Google
# Details:
Develop the scraper script that fetches business listings from Yelp Fusion and Google Places APIs based on zip codes and verticals. Store the results in the businesses table. This task corresponds to the scraper_poc task in the Next-Step Blueprint.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the scraper can successfully fetch HVAC leads for zip code 10002 as specified in acceptance test F 1.1.

   - Place details: $0.17 per request

4. Developed data processing functions to transform API responses and save to database

5. Implemented ZIP code to coordinate conversion to enable location-based searches

2. Implemented the save_business function that stores scraped business data in the businesses table with comprehensive error handling to prevent data loss.

3. Developed utility functions to retrieve configuration data:
   - get_active_zip_codes: Retrieves zip codes that need to be processed
   - get_verticals: Retrieves business verticals for targeting

4. Added mark_zip_done function to update the processing status of zip codes after completion, preventing redundant scraping.

5. Implemented track_api_cost function to monitor API usage costs, supporting budget management and cost optimization.

6. Created data transformation functions:
   - process_yelp_business: Transforms Yelp API response data into the database schema format
   - process_google_place: Transforms Google Places API data into the database schema format

7. Ensured data integrity by wrapping all database operations in transactions and implementing proper exception handling with specific error responses.

The implementation adheres to Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, featuring structured logging, robust error handling, and efficient database connection management. All database interactions use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
