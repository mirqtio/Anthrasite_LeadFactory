Install pre-commit hooks in the repository\n3. Update CI pipeline to run `pre-commit run --all-files` as part of the build process\n4. Add documentation for developers on how to work with the pre-commit hooks\n5. Ensure all existing code passes the new static analysis checks\n\nThis implementation will enforce code quality standards at commit time, reducing the likelihood of quality issues making it into the codebase and ensuring consistent formatting and security practices. Implementing this first will ensure all subsequent code changes follow the established standards.",
