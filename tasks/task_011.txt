# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement RSYNC Fallback Script
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create SPOF fallback mechanism as specified in ยง2
# Details:
Develop the RSYNC backup script for nightly mirroring to VPS. Implement health check and auto-boot mechanisms.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the RSYNC fallback correctly mirrors data to VPS and auto-boots Docker stack after consecutive failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement RSYNC backup script [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the rsync_backup.sh script for nightly mirroring to VPS
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T09:13:04.492Z>
Implemented a comprehensive rsync_backup.sh script for secure data mirroring to a remote VPS. The implementation includes:

1. A robust bash script with secure data mirroring capabilities
2. YAML configuration parsing for flexible configuration management
3. Comprehensive error handling with specific exit codes for different failure scenarios
4. SSH connection testing and verification before backup attempts
5. Lock file mechanism to prevent concurrent backup operations
6. Retention policy implementation for managing backup history and storage
7. Notification system integration for email and Slack alerts on success/failure
8. Dry-run mode for testing configuration without making actual changes
9. Detailed logging system with timestamps and severity levels
10. Sample configuration file with comprehensive options and documentation
11. Proper file permissions (executable) for the script

The implementation adheres to Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, focusing on robust error handling, appropriate logging, and clear documentation. The script provides a reliable SPOF (Single Point of Failure) fallback mechanism for the Lead-Factory project, ensuring data integrity and availability.

## 2. Implement health check script [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the health_check.sh script for monitoring and auto-boot
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T09:18:33.567Z>
The health check script implementation has been completed with the following features:

1. Comprehensive health check script with auto-boot capabilities for the fallback system
2. HTTP endpoint monitoring functionality to track the primary instance health status
3. Failure threshold tracking with persistent state management to prevent false positives
4. SSH-based Docker stack deployment mechanism for the backup VPS activation
5. YAML configuration parsing for flexible and maintainable configuration options
6. Notification system integration for both email and Slack alerts on status changes
7. Multiple operation modes including check-only and force-boot for different scenarios
8. Detailed logging system with timestamps and severity levels for troubleshooting
9. Lock file mechanism implementation to prevent concurrent script executions
10. Sample configuration file with comprehensive options and documentation
11. Proper executable permissions set on the script file

The implementation adheres to the Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, featuring robust error handling, appropriate logging levels, and clear inline documentation. The script provides a reliable auto-boot mechanism that complements the RSYNC backup script to create a complete SPOF fallback solution.

## 3. Document RSYNC fallback mechanism [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update project documentation with RSYNC fallback details
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T09:20:33.386Z>
The RSYNC fallback mechanism documentation has been completed and integrated into the project documentation. The documentation includes:

1. Comprehensive documentation in README.md covering the Single Point of Failure (SPOF) fallback mechanism
2. Detailed documentation for the rsync_backup.sh script, including:
   - Usage examples
   - Configuration parameters
   - Command-line options
   - Error handling procedures

3. Documentation for the health_check.sh script, including:
   - Usage examples
   - Monitoring capabilities
   - Alert configurations
   - Integration with the fallback system

4. Step-by-step setup instructions for implementing the fallback mechanism:
   - Initial configuration
   - Server setup requirements
   - Network configuration
   - Permission settings

5. Cron job configuration examples for scheduling regular backups and health checks:
   - Recommended scheduling patterns
   - Example crontab entries
   - Logging considerations

6. Logical documentation structure with clear sections for:
   - Overview
   - Installation
   - Configuration
   - Usage
   - Troubleshooting
   - FAQ

7. Documentation follows established project style guidelines and formatting conventions

8. All documentation has been properly placed in the Data Durability section of the project documentation

The completed documentation provides team members with clear guidance on understanding, configuring, and using the RSYNC fallback mechanism for SPOF protection.
