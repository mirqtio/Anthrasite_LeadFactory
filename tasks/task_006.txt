# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Mockup Generation (05_mockup.py)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the fifth pipeline stage for GPT-4o/Claude mockup generation
# Details:
Develop the mockup generation script that uses GPT-4o to create website improvement mockups. Implement Claude fallback logic and tier-based mockup generation. This task corresponds to the mockup_proto task in the Next-Step Blueprint.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the mockup generation process works correctly for different tiers as specified in acceptance tests F 5.1 and F 5.2.

1. Created a GPT4oMockupGenerator class that handles all aspects of website mockup generation
2. Developed structured prompt generation system that incorporates business data and specific design requirements
3. Implemented JSON response parsing functionality to extract both mockup images and HTML code
4. Added comprehensive token usage tracking with associated cost calculation
5. Built robust error handling with specific exception types for different failure scenarios
6. Integrated detailed logging throughout all operations for debugging and monitoring
7. Implemented timeout mechanisms to prevent operations from hanging indefinitely
8. Added support for customizable mockup styles and multiple resolution options

The implementation strictly adheres to Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, ensuring all API operations have proper error handling, appropriate logging levels, and explicit timeouts. The GPT-4o integration delivers high-quality mockup generation with detailed design suggestions that match the specified requirements.

## 2. Implement Claude fallback logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions to use Claude as a fallback when GPT-4o fails
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:40:32.129Z>
The Claude fallback logic implementation has been completed with the following components:

1. Created a ClaudeMockupGenerator class that serves as a fallback when GPT-4o fails to generate mockups
2. Developed structured prompt generation specifically optimized for Claude while maintaining similarity to GPT-4o's approach
3. Implemented robust response parsing using regex to reliably extract both JSON and HTML content from Claude's responses
4. Added token usage tracking and cost calculation functionality based on Claude's specific pricing model
5. Implemented comprehensive error handling with specific exception types to properly manage Claude API failures
6. Integrated detailed logging for all fallback operations to facilitate debugging and monitoring
7. Created intelligent fallback logic in the generate_business_mockup function that determines when to use Claude
8. Added conditional evaluation logic to ensure Claude results are only used when they provide better quality than GPT-4o's partial results

The implementation adheres to Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, featuring robust error handling mechanisms, appropriate logging levels, and explicit timeouts for all API operations. The fallback system ensures high availability of the mockup generation service by providing a reliable alternative when the primary model encounters issues.

## 3. Implement tier-based mockup generation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create conditional logic for tier-based mockup features
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:41:06.199Z>
The tier-based mockup generation implementation has been completed with the following features:

1. Implemented tier-based filtering in the get_businesses_for_mockup function to ensure appropriate business selection based on tier level
2. Added validation logic to enforce minimum tier requirements (Tier 2) for mockup generation
3. Integrated screenshot URL functionality specifically for Tier 2+ businesses
4. Implemented command-line tier override option for testing and manual processing
5. Added comprehensive error handling for tier-specific features and edge cases
6. Implemented detailed logging system to track tier-based decision making
7. Created business scoring prioritization system that processes highest-scored businesses first
8. Added environment variable configuration support for flexible tier settings

The implementation adheres to Windsurf Global AI Rules v1.1, ensuring robust error handling, appropriate logging levels, and proper security practices throughout. The tier-based approach optimizes resource allocation by providing more comprehensive mockups to higher-tier businesses while maintaining basic functionality for lower tiers.

## 4. Implement database and storage integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create functions for database operations and image storage
### Details:
<info added on 2025-05-20T01:41:45.241Z>
The database and storage integration implementation has been completed with the following components:

1. Implemented get_businesses_for_mockup function with comprehensive support for:
   - Limiting the number of businesses processed
   - Filtering by specific business ID
   - Tier-based filtering to align with the mockup generation strategy
   - Force regeneration option to recreate mockups when needed

2. Created save_mockup function with proper transaction handling to ensure data integrity

3. Implemented save_mockup_image function for Supabase Storage integration, enabling secure storage of generated mockup images

4. Added base64 image handling and conversion capabilities to facilitate image processing and storage
