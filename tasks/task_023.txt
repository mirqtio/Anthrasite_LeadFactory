# Task ID: 23
# Title: Database Migration to Supabase Postgres
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate from local SQLite to Supabase Postgres and implement backup and recovery procedures
# Details:
Implement the following database migration and durability features:

1. Switch from local SQLite to Supabase Postgres using DATABASE_URL environment variable
2. Add nightly pg_dump into RSYNC backup set
3. Ensure WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) and point-in-time recovery are enabled or documented
4. Update README and deployment guide with new database configuration
5. Update tests and CI pipeline to spin up Postgres service for testing

This migration will improve database durability, scalability, and backup capabilities while maintaining compatibility with existing code.

# Test Strategy:
All code changes must follow the standard Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27) for development, testing, quality assurance, pre-commit checks, and CI verification before being considered complete. This includes proper unit and integration testing of database connections, migration processes, backup procedures, and recovery mechanisms.
