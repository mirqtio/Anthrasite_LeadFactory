# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Budget Audit Task
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 10
# Priority: high
# Description: Create budget audit mechanism as specified in ยง8
# Details:
Develop comprehensive cost tracking for all API calls. Implement budget reporting and scaling gate mechanisms. The scaling gate includes thresholds, configuration constants, activation/deactivation functions, operation permission checks, and a critical operation whitelist for essential functions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the budget audit correctly tracks costs and enforces scaling gate. Test scaling gate activation/deactivation, operation permissions, and ensure critical operations on the whitelist function properly.
