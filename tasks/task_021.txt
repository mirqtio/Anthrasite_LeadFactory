# Task ID: 21
# Title: Metrics and Alerts Completeness
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement additional metrics and alerts for batch completion, cost tracking, and GPU usage
# Details:
Implement the following metrics and alerts:

1. Batch-completion gauge - Write `batch_end_timestamp` at end of run and alert if no completion by 05:00 EST
2. Cost-per-lead metric - Compute at run end (`total_cost/processed_leads`) and export; add optional alert if Tier-1 > $3
3. GPU cost metric - When burst flag is on, increment `gpu_cost_usd_total` hourly; alert daily if > $25

These metrics will provide better visibility into system performance, cost efficiency, and resource utilization, enabling proactive monitoring and optimization.

# Test Strategy:
All code changes for metrics and alerts implementation must follow the standard Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27), including development, testing, quality assurance, pre-commit checks, and CI verification before being considered complete. Each metric and alert should be thoroughly tested in isolation and as part of the integrated system.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Batch-Completion Gauge and Alerts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and implement the batch-completion gauge that writes the batch_end_timestamp at the end of each run and creates an alert if no completion is detected by 05:00 EST.
### Details:
1. Create a function to record batch_end_timestamp when a batch run completes
2. Implement a monitoring check that verifies completion status by 05:00 EST
3. Set up alert notification system (email/Slack) if completion is not detected
4. Add logging for successful completions and alert triggers
5. Test the system with simulated late completions to verify alert functionality

## 2. Develop Cost-Per-Lead Metric and Alerts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a metric that calculates cost-per-lead at the end of each run by dividing total_cost by processed_leads, export this data, and implement an optional alert if Tier-1 cost exceeds $3.
### Details:
1. Implement calculation logic for cost-per-lead metric (total_cost/processed_leads)
2. Create data export mechanism for the metric to analytics dashboard
3. Add configuration for Tier-1 cost threshold alert (default $3)
4. Implement alert notification when threshold is exceeded
5. Include historical tracking to show cost trends over time

## 3. Implement GPU Cost Tracking and Alerts [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a system to track GPU costs by incrementing gpu_cost_usd_total hourly when the burst flag is enabled, and implement a daily alert if the cost exceeds $25.
### Details:
1. Develop mechanism to detect when burst flag is enabled
2. Implement hourly incrementation of gpu_cost_usd_total metric
3. Create daily cost aggregation and threshold checking logic
4. Set up alert system for when daily GPU costs exceed $25
5. Add reporting dashboard component to visualize GPU usage and costs over time

## 4. Implement GPU_BURST Flag for Cost Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 21.3
### Description: Ensure GPU cost metric increments when GPU_BURST=1 environment flag is set
### Details:
1. Implement detection of GPU_BURST=1 environment variable
2. Modify the GPU cost tracking system to check this flag before incrementing costs
3. Add hourly incrementation of gpu_cost_usd_total when flag is enabled
4. Create a test environment with GPU_BURST flag to verify functionality
5. Document the GPU_BURST flag in the environment variable documentation
6. Ensure the daily alert triggers correctly when costs exceed $25

## 5. Workflow Compliance Verification [done]
### Dependencies: 21.1, 21.2, 21.3, 21.4
### Description: Ensure all metrics and alerts implementations comply with the Feature Development Workflow Template
### Details:
1. Review all code changes against the Feature Development Workflow Template (Task #27)
2. Verify that proper testing, quality assurance, and pre-commit checks have been performed
3. Confirm CI verification has been completed for all implementations
4. Document compliance with the workflow for each metric and alert component
5. Address any workflow compliance gaps before considering the task complete
