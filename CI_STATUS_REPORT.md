# CI Status Report - Tasks 54-60 Implementation

## Summary
All code changes for Tasks 54-60 have been successfully implemented, tested locally, and pushed to the master branch. However, CI verification is blocked due to a GitHub Actions major outage.

## Implementation Status
✅ **All 7 tasks completed and pushed to master**
- Commit: 68ae102
- Branch: master
- Push Time: 2025-06-05 18:24:29Z

## CI Verification Status
❌ **Unable to verify CI due to GitHub Actions outage**

### GitHub Service Status
- **Status**: Major Outage (as of 2025-06-05)
- **Impact**: Degraded availability for GitHub Actions
- **Symptoms**: Delays in jobs starting or job failures
- **Source**: https://www.githubstatus.com/

### CI Run Attempts
1. **Run 15474480539** (push-triggered)
   - Status: Queued for 25+ minutes
   - Action taken: Cancelled due to timeout

2. **Run 15474780295** (manual trigger)
   - Status: Queued for 7+ minutes
   - Action taken: Cancelled

3. **Run 15474670449** (manual trigger)
   - Status: Cancelled after 9+ minutes in queue

## Local Test Results
All tests passed locally before push:
- ✅ Unit tests: 100+ new tests added
- ✅ Integration tests: All passing
- ✅ BDD tests: Core functionality tested
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks: All passing (ruff, black, bandit)

## Code Quality
- No linting errors
- No type checking errors
- Security checks passed
- Code formatting compliant

## Recommendation
The implementation is complete and all local tests pass. The CI verification should be re-attempted once GitHub Actions service is restored. The code changes are production-ready based on local validation.

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Status page for service restoration
2. Re-run CI once Actions is operational
3. Verify CI logs show all tests passing
4. Continue with remaining TaskMaster tasks
