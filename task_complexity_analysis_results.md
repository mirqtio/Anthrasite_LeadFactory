# Task Complexity Analysis Results

## Overview
Successfully parsed changes.md as a PRD and added 7 new tasks (IDs 54-60) to TaskMaster.

## Complexity Analysis Summary

### Low Complexity Tasks (Ready for Implementation)
- **Task #54: Parse and Store City/State** (2 hours) - Simple data parsing task
- **Task #57: Embed Website Thumbnail in Email** (4 hours) - Straightforward HTML modification

### Medium Complexity Tasks (Need Careful Planning)
- **Task #55: Yelp JSON Retention** (6 hours) - Policy decision + implementation
- **Task #58: AI Content with Email Template** (8 hours) - Compliance-critical integration
- **Task #60: Per-Service Cost Caps** (6 hours) - Financial control system

### High Complexity Tasks (Need Expanded Subtasks)
- **Task #56: Local Screenshot Capture** (8 hours) - Browser automation complexity
- **Task #59: Auto-Monitor Bounce Rate & IP Warmup** (6 hours) - Complex deliverability monitoring

## Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (6 hours)
1. Task #54 - Parse and Store City/State (2h)
2. Task #57 - Embed Website Thumbnail (4h)

### Phase 2: Core Infrastructure (20 hours)
3. Task #55 - Yelp JSON Retention (6h)
4. Task #56 - Local Screenshot Capture (8h)
5. Task #58 - AI Content Integration (8h)

### Phase 3: Operational Controls (14 hours)
6. Task #60 - Per-Service Cost Caps (6h)
7. Task #59 - Bounce Rate Monitoring (6h)

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk (Requires Expert Implementation)
- **Task #56**: Browser automation can be fragile
- **Task #59**: Email deliverability is reputation-critical

### Medium Risk (Requires Validation)
- **Task #55**: Privacy policy decisions need legal review
- **Task #58**: CAN-SPAM compliance is legally required
- **Task #60**: Financial controls need thorough testing

### Low Risk (Standard Development)
- **Task #54**: Standard data parsing
- **Task #57**: HTML template modification

## Total Impact
- **7 new tasks** addressing critical gaps from changes.md
- **40 hours** total estimated effort
- **4 sprint** recommended timeline
- **All gaps** from PRD analysis now tracked in TaskMaster

## Next Steps
1. Prioritize Task #54 (Parse City/State) for immediate implementation
2. Plan Phase 1 tasks for next sprint
3. Begin technical research for high-complexity tasks (#56, #59)
4. Schedule stakeholder review for privacy/compliance tasks (#55, #58)
