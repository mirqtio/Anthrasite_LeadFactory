# Cost Tracking and Budget Management

This directory will contain modules related to cost tracking and budget management:

- `budget_gate.py` - Budget gating mechanism to prevent expensive operations
- `cost_tracking.py` - Tracking API and computation costs
- `cost_metrics.py` - Cost metrics collection and reporting

## Migration Plan

1. Move the cost-related modules from `bin/` to this directory
2. Consolidate duplicate cost-tracking modules from `utils/`
3. Update all imports to use relative imports within the package
4. Remove any path manipulation hacks with `sys.path.insert()`
5. Create proper `__init__.py` file to expose key functionality
