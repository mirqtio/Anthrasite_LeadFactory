   - Storage optimization strategy

2. **[55] Support local PDF delivery**
   - Alternative delivery method
   - Depends on task 53

## Complexity Analysis

Based on our analysis, 6 high-priority tasks were identified as highly complex and have been broken down into subtasks:

- Each complex task now has 5 detailed subtasks
- Total subtasks added: 30
- This ensures manageable implementation chunks

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Start with high-priority tasks** that have no dependencies
2. **Focus on cost-saving measures** (tasks 47, 56) early for immediate ROI
3. **Ensure compliance** (task 50) before scaling email operations
4. **Build infrastructure** (task 46) early for reliability
5. **Implement monitoring** throughout for operational visibility

## Dependencies

- Task 49 (Email thumbnail) depends on Task 48 (GPT mockup)
- Task 55 (Local PDF delivery) depends on Task 53 (Audit PDF)
- Task 60 (Test coverage) depends on all other tasks (41-59)

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize subtasks for the 6 complex tasks
2. Assign resources to high-priority items
3. Set up tracking for task completion velocity
4. Begin implementation with infrastructure and compliance tasks
