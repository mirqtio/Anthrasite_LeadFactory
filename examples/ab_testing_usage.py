A/B Testing Usage Examples
==========================

This file demonstrates how to use the A/B testing framework for email subject lines
and pricing optimization in the Lead Factory system.

Examples include:
1. Creating email subject line tests
2. Setting up pricing experiments
3. Integrating with existing email and payment systems
4. Analyzing test results and statistical significance
5. Making data-driven decisions
